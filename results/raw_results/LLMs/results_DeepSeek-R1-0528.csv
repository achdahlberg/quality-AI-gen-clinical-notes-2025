Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two versions of a clinical case where the variation type"" is deletion. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In **Medical History**, the modified version removes ""Parkinson's disease"" - that's a clear deletion of a chronic condition.

The **Hospital Course** section has several alterations:
- ""DT pulmonary arteries without signs of pulmonary embolism or pericardial fluid"" becomes just ""DT pulmonary arteries"" - removing two negative findings.
- The entire segment about unprotected sex and HIV diagnosis is gone, including the positive test and specific medications (Truvada/Tivicay).
- Neurological exam now omits ""rigidity as in Parkinson's disease"" and the question about HIV explaining neurological issues.
- The hemolytic anemia discussion with hematologist is deleted.

**Medications** show three removals: Madopark (Parkinson's drug), Tivicay and Truvada (HIV medications).

**Plan after discharge** loses infectious disease follow-up.

**Diagnosis** section deletes Parkinson's entirely.

**Main Diagnosis** completely removes both HIV (B23.8) and hemolytic anemia (D59.9) codes.

I'm counting 8 distinct medical deletions that alter patient management: Parkinson's history/diagnosis/meds, HIV diagnosis/meds/follow-up, hemolytic anemia, and two PE/pericardium findings. Rephrasings like ""fever and skin rash"" without the unprotected sex context aren't counted as meaningful changes.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two versions of a clinical case where Parkinson's disease information was deleted. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason for admission"" is identical - no changes there. In ""Medical history"", the modified version removes ""Parkinson's disease"" - that's clearly a meaningful deletion affecting the patient's clinical profile.

Moving to ""Hospital course"", I notice three key deletions: 
1) The removal of ""rigidity as in Parkinson's disease"" from neurological findings
2) Omission of the HIV diagnosis and specific medications (Truvada/Tivicay)
3) Removal of the question about neurological symptoms being HIV-related

The ""Medications"" section shows two Parkinson's drugs missing: Madopark and the HIV medications. The ""Diagnosis"" section deletes Parkinson's disease entirely. Finally, the ""Main diagnosis"" removes the HIV infection code (B23.8).

I'm counting each distinct medical concept deletion separately: Parkinson's (history, symptoms, diagnosis, meds) and HIV (diagnosis, meds, clinical question). That totals 6 meaningful changes. Minor phrasing differences like ""forund"" vs ""found"" don't count as they don't alter meaning.

The user seems to need precise change tracking - probably for medical documentation audits. I'll respond with just the number as requested.

Alright, let's tackle this medical text comparison. The task is to count meaningful changes between the original and modified clinical case, ignoring rephrasings or synonyms that don't alter the medical meaning. 

First, I'll go through each section systematically. Starting with ""Reason for admission"": both versions are identical, so no changes there. 

Next, ""Medical history"": the original includes ""Parkinson's disease"" along with hypertension and DVT, but the modified version deletes Parkinson's. That's a clear deletion of a medical condition, which is meaningful. 

Moving to ""Hospital course"": the original mentions ""bradykinesia, rigidity as in Parkinson's disease"" and Babinski's sign. The modified version removes ""rigidity as in Parkinson's disease"" but keeps bradykinesia and Babinski's. Deleting the specific link to Parkinson's here alters the neurological findings, especially since Parkinson's was also removed from history. Also, the original states ""No neuromuscular etiology has been found"" which is absent in the modified version. This omission changes the conclusion about unexplained neurological symptoms. 

In ""Medications"": Madopark (for Parkinson's) is removed in the modified version. Since Parkinson's was deleted from history, removing its treatment is consistent but still a meaningful deletion. 

""Diagnosis"" section: original lists Parkinson's, hypertension, DVT. Modified only has hypertension and DVT—another deletion of Parkinson's. 

""Main diagnosis"" remains unchanged (HIV and hemolytic anemia). 

So, the key deletions are: 
1. Parkinson's from medical history 
2. Rigidity linked to Parkinson's in neurological findings 
3. Madopark from medications 
4. Parkinson's from diagnosis list 
5. The statement about no neuromuscular etiology found 

Each deletion alters the medical narrative: removing Parkinson's as a condition, its symptoms, treatment, and a diagnostic conclusion. That's five distinct deletions. However, since removing Parkinson's from history likely drives the other deletions (meds, diagnosis), but each section's change is independently meaningful, I'll count them separately. 

Final count: 5 meaningful changes.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason for admission"" is identical - no changes there. In ""Medical history"", the modified version replaces ""Hypertension"" and ""Deep vein thrombosis"" with ""Diabetes mellitus type 2"" and ""Stroke"" - that's two significant changes since these are different conditions. 

The ""Hospital course"" shows a crucial modification: the neurological symptoms attribution shifts from ""HIV infection"" to ""sepsis"" in the modified text. This changes the clinical interpretation. The ""Medications"" section remains unchanged. 

In ""Plan after discharge"", the modified version adds ""coagulation clinic"" to follow-up - that's one addition. Finally, the ""Diagnosis"" section adds ""Sepsis"" as a new diagnosis while removing ""Hypertension"" - net two changes (one addition, one removal). 

The ICD codes stay identical. All changes I noted alter medical meaning: new comorbidities (diabetes, stroke), different neurological attribution (sepsis vs HIV), added follow-up specialty, and diagnosis list modifications. 

That totals five meaningful changes: 
1. Medical history: hypertension → diabetes 
2. Medical history: DVT → stroke 
3. Hospital course: HIV → sepsis attribution 
4. Discharge plan: added coagulation clinic 
5. Diagnosis: added sepsis, removed hypertension

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In Medical History:
- ""Hypertension"" remains unchanged
- ""Deep vein thrombosis"" changed to ""Stroke"" - this is significant as DVT and stroke are different conditions
- Added ""Diabetes mellitus type 2"" - new comorbidity

Hospital Course:
- Removed unprotected sex leading to fever/rash
- Added drug use and injections during vacation
- Added absence of hepatitis vaccines
- Changed HIV diagnosis to HIV + Hepatitis B co-infection
- Changed neurological question from HIV to sepsis explanation
- Added Entecavir for hepatitis B in medications

Plan after discharge:
- Added ""coagulation clinic"" to follow-up

Diagnosis:
- Added ""Sepsis"" as new diagnosis
- Added ""B19.1"" hepatitis B code

The HIV treatment remains, but hepatitis B treatment is new. The neurological findings are identical but with different diagnostic considerations (HIV vs sepsis). 

Counting these: 
1. DVT→Stroke in history
2. Added diabetes
3. Removed fever/rash from unprotected sex
4. Added drug use/injections
5. Added no vaccines
6. Added hepatitis B diagnosis
7. Changed neuro symptom attribution to sepsis
8. Added Entecavir
9. Added coagulation follow-up
10. Added sepsis diagnosis
11. Added hepatitis B ICD code

That's 11 meaningful changes. The hemolytic anemia and HIV remain, but the new elements significantly alter the clinical picture - particularly hepatitis B, sepsis, and stroke instead of DVT.

- The HIV exposure narrative changes from ""unprotected sex"" to include ""taken many drugs... injections"" and adds ""No hepatitis vaccines"" 
- that's one addition. 
- Hepatitis B diagnosis is added - another change. 
- The neurological query shifts from ""HIV infection?"" to ""sepsis?"" - meaningful modification. 
- Oxygen saturation drops from 94% to 84% with corresponding ICU transfer for antibiotics - two interconnected changes. 

In ""Medications"": 
- HIV drugs (Tivicay/Truvada) are replaced with Cefoxitin and Entecavir - one deletion and one addition. 
- The ""Plan after discharge"" adds coagulation clinic follow-up and physiotherapy - two additions. 

""Diagnosis"" section: 
- Sepsis replaces hypertension as primary diagnosis 
- Hepatitis B added 
- Hemolytic anemia diagnosis removed 
- that's three changes. 

""Main diagnosis"" codes completely change: 
- Sepsis (A41.9) added 
- Hepatitis B (B19.1) added 
- Hemolytic anemia (D59.9) removed 
- HIV (B23.8) remains

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason for admission/hospitalization"" changes ""stay"" to ""trip"" - that's just synonym-level, no medical impact. ""Hospital course"" becoming ""hospital stay"" is also non-meaningful phrasing. 

Looking at medical details: ""EF"" expanded to ""ejection fraction"" is clarification without change. ""MetHb 5.6"" remains identical, as do all lab values. ""No signs of infection in lab"" vs ""No infection-signs in lab"" is word order difference. 

Key medical events: The HIV diagnosis section changes ""Tested positive for HIV"" to ""Positive HIV test"" and ""treatment with Truvada and Tivicay"" to ""antiviral therapy (Truvada and Tivicay)"" - still equivalent. Neurological findings are identical including the typo ""forund"". 

Imaging changes: ""MRI of the brain and spine"" vs ""brain and spinal cord"" - ""spine"" and ""spinal cord"" are clinically synonymous here. ""EMG"" to ""Electromyography"" is just expansion. The question about HIV explaining symptoms remains unchanged. 

Medications and discharge plans are identical. Crucially, all diagnoses and ICD codes match exactly. 

Wait - did I miss anything? The weight loss mention (""10kg since October"") is identical. Even the Babinski sign and fasciculations are unchanged. The only potential candidate was ""spine"" vs ""spinal cord"", but in neurological context these refer to the same imaging study. 

Final check confirms no additions, deletions or medically significant modifications. All alterations are either synonyms (""stay/trip""), abbreviations (""EF/ejection fraction""), or grammatical rephrasing without clinical impact.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two clinical case versions while ignoring synonymous rephrasing. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason for admission/hospitalization"" shows ""admitted"" vs ""hospitalizaiton"" (which appears to be a typo) and ""stay in Spain"" vs ""trip to Spain"" - these seem like equivalent terms in medical context. 

Moving to ""Hospital course"", I notice:
- ""EF"" expanded to ""ejection fraction"" - this is just clarification of an abbreviation
- ""No signs of infection in lab"" vs ""No infection-signs in lab"" - inverted word order with identical meaning
- ""Tested positive for HIV"" vs ""Positive HIV test"" - same information presented differently
- ""Lab with image as in hemolytic anemia"" remains unchanged in meaning despite minor wording differences

The neurological findings, medications, diagnoses and ICD codes are identical. The typo in ""hospitalizaiton"" doesn't affect medical meaning. 

After thorough comparison, I conclude there are zero changes that alter clinical meaning. All modifications are either synonymous substitutions or grammatical rephrasing that maintain the original medical content. The user's strict criteria about ignoring meaning-preserving changes means the count should be zero.

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason for admission/hospitalization"" changes ""stay"" to ""trip"" - that's just synonym substitution with no medical impact. ""Hospital course"" vs ""Hospital stay"" is also equivalent phrasing. 

Looking at the medical details: ""Normal EF"" becomes ""Normal ejection fraction"" - this is standard abbreviation expansion. ""No signs of infection in lab"" vs ""No infection-signs in lab"" is a trivial word order change. ""Tested positive for HIV"" to ""Positive HIV test"" conveys identical information. 

The medication section has ""Current medications"" instead of ""Medications"" - purely presentational. ""Plan after discharge"" adds ""Scheduled outpatient"" but keeps the same follow-up intent. Diagnosis changes ""DVT"" to spelled-out ""Deep vein thrombosis"" - no clinical difference. 

Notable changes: 
1. ""antiviral therapy"" replaces ""treatment with"" - slightly more specific but same drugs referenced
2. ""spinal cord"" instead of ""spine"" in MRI description - anatomically equivalent
3. ""Electromyography"" for ""EMG"" - standard abbreviation
4. ""Patient stable on room air"" vs ""saturates at 94%"" - same clinical status

The ICD codes and all critical findings (HIV, hemolytic anemia, neurological signs) remain unchanged. No additions/deletions of medical facts. All modifications appear to be linguistic variations without altering clinical meaning.

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason of admission"" shows a deletion: the modified version removes ""and jaundice"" from the presenting symptoms. Since jaundice is a key clinical sign of liver dysfunction, this omission alters the medical picture significantly.

Moving to ""Treatment course"", I notice two deletions: 
1. The removal of ""Jaundiced appearance of skin and sclerae"" - this directly relates to liver failure and supports the main diagnosis.
2. The removal of ""severe itchiness"" from the symptom list - pruritus is another important hepatic symptom.

Other sections like Medical history, Medications, and Diagnoses appear identical. The bilirubin level removal (290 from 680) in the modified version's treatment course is particularly significant as it documents clinical improvement.

These three deletions (jaundice admission reason, jaundice observation, and bilirubin levels) all materially change the clinical narrative. The itchiness removal is less critical but still a meaningful symptom deletion. 

The user emphasized ignoring rephrasings, so I won't count minor wording changes like ""developes"" vs ""develops"". Only substantive medical information losses matter here. 

Final count: 4 meaningful deletions that impact clinical understanding.

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason of admission"" shows a deletion: ""jaundice"" is missing from the modified version. Since jaundice is a key symptom of liver disease, this alters the clinical presentation meaningfully.

In ""Medical history"", the phrase ""Relapse of alcohol dependence in December"" is deleted. This omission affects the patient's alcohol use timeline, which is clinically relevant for alcoholic hepatitis diagnosis.

The ""Treatment course"" has multiple changes:
- ""jaundiced appearance of skin and sclerae"" removal - this directly relates to liver dysfunction severity
- ""Glasgow alcoholic hepatitis score"" becoming just ""Glasgow hepatitis score"" - the specificity matters for diagnosis
- ""severe itchiness"" deletion - pruritus can indicate cholestasis
- ""Prednisolone for decompensated alcoholic hepatitis"" becoming just ""decompensated hepatitis"" - again, specificity loss
- Bilirubin value 290 with comparison to previous 680 is missing - this obscures clinical improvement

""Secondary diagnosis"" shows ""Anorexia nervosa"" was deleted, which impacts nutritional assessment and care planning.

Other sections like medications and procedures remain identical. Rephrasings like ""Prednisolone paused"" vs original wording don't count as meaningful changes.

I'm being careful to ignore minor phrasing differences that don't alter medical meaning, focusing only on substantive deletions affecting clinical interpretation. The total comes to 6 meaningful deletions across the document.

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In **Reason for Admission**, the modified version deletes ""and jaundice"" from the presenting symptoms. Jaundice is a key clinical indicator of liver dysfunction, so this removal changes the medical picture.

The **Medical History** section shows two deletions: ""Anorexia nervosa"" is entirely removed, which is a significant comorbidity affecting nutritional status. Also, ""Relapse of alcohol dependence in December"" is deleted, weakening the alcohol-related context crucial for alcoholic hepatitis diagnosis.

Moving to **Treatment Course**, I notice multiple meaningful deletions:
- ""Jaundiced appearance of skin and sclerae"" is removed, which directly relates to liver failure.
- The Glasgow score is now ""Glasgow hepatitis score"" instead of ""Glasgow alcoholic hepatitis score"" - the removal of ""alcoholic"" blurs the etiology.
- ""severe itchiness"" (likely pruritus) is deleted from symptoms.
- The vomiting episode description ""cascade vomiting with blood"" and subsequent treatments (glypressin, Nexium) are missing.
- Details about variceal bleeding (""highly suspected bleeding from varices with red spots"") during the second gastroscopy are gone.
- The bilirubin level improvement (290 from 680) is deleted, which showed treatment response.

In **Secondary Diagnosis**, ""Anorexia nervosa"" and ""Gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" are removed, simplifying the patient's comorbidity profile.

All other sections (Medications, Plan, Procedures, Diagnoses) appear unchanged. The core alcoholic hepatitis diagnosis remains, but the deletions collectively reduce clinical severity indicators and alcohol history context. 

Counting these: 
1. Jaundice deletion in admission reason
2. Anorexia nervosa removal in history
3. Alcohol relapse deletion
4. Jaundice description removal in exam
5. ""Alcoholic"" dropped from Glasgow score
6. Pruritus symptom removal
7. Hematemesis episode and treatments
8. Variceal bleeding details in gastroscopy
9. Bilirubin trend deletion

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In **Reason for Admission**, the jaundice duration changed from ""a month"" to ""6 months"" - that's a clinically significant alteration in symptom chronicity.

The **Medical History** shows two key changes: removal of ""Gastrointestinal hemorrhage 2020 that were caused by esophageal varices"" and addition of ""GERD"". Deleting the hemorrhage history removes important context about portal hypertension complications, while adding GERD introduces a new comorbidity.

**Treatment Course** has multiple meaningful changes:
- Inflammatory markers: CRP dropped from 51 to 5 and leukocytes from 13.5 to 11.5, suggesting less infection/inflammation
- ALAT increased from 1.61 to 2.61, indicating different liver injury pattern
- Added CT finding of ""6x5cm tumor in bile duct"" with biopsy - this introduces potential malignancy
- Added ""oxynorm for pain management"" as new medication
- Removed ""decompensated with development of ascites"" which was originally part of the alcoholic hepatitis presentation
- Changed ""decompensated alcoholic hepatitis"" to just ""decompensated hepatitis"" - removing etiology specificity

The **Plan after Discharge** now specifies ""urgent referral to oncology"" instead of gastroenterology, reflecting the new cancer concern.

All other sections (Medications, Procedures, Diagnoses) appear unchanged. The differential diagnosis still lists K70.4 despite the new tumor finding, which might be inconsistent but wasn't modified.

Counting these: duration change, history removal, history addition, CRP/leukocytes/ALAT values, tumor addition, oxynorm addition, ascites removal, hepatitis specification change, and referral change - that's 9 distinct meaningful alterations. The biopsy mention seems part of the tumor addition cluster.

I won't count the unchanged differential diagnosis as it wasn't modified in the text. The core task is counting deliberate changes, not evaluating diagnostic consistency.

   - **Addition in modified version**: ""CT abdomen taken, with suspected 6 x 5 cm tumor in the bile duct"". This introduces a new finding (possible malignancy) not in original. **Count: 1**  
   - Prednisolone indication: Original specifies ""decompensated alcoholic hepatitis"", modified says ""decompensated hepatitis"". Removal of ""alcoholic"" might imply broader etiology, but contextually still refers to same condition. Not a meaningful change.  
   - Other details (vomiting blood, procedures, lab trends) appear identical.

3. **Plan after discharge**:  
   Original: ""gastroenterological office""  
   Modified: ""oncological office""  
   → Change in follow-up specialty due to added tumor suspicion. **Count: 1**

4. **Diagnoses**:

The ""Medical history"" shows two key changes: removal of ""Gastrointestinal hemorrhage 2020"" and addition of ""GERD"". Both modify the patient's clinical background substantially.

The ""Treatment course"" has multiple meaningful changes:
- CRP from 51 to 5 and leukocytes from 13.5 to 11.5 suggest different infection severity
- ALAT increased from 1.61 to 2.61
- Addition of CT finding (6x5cm bile duct tumor) and biopsy for suspected carcinoma
- Removal of ascites development
- Addition of oxynorm for pain
- The entire episode about patient being drunk with BAC 2.5 is new
- ""Disappears from ward"" replaces ""discharged""

""Plan after discharge"" completely changes from gastroenterology follow-up to urgent oncology referral with added details about false contact information.

""Secondary diagnosis"" replaces ""Gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" with ""GERD"".

""Main diagnosis"" shifts from alcoholic hepatitis (K70.11) to bile duct carcinoma (C22.1) - this is the most critical change.

I'm noting that medications and procedures sections appear identical, and differential diagnosis remains K70.4. The main diagnosis change alone would be significant, but combined with the tumor finding, altered lab trends, and new alcohol intoxication episode, these clearly constitute multiple distinct medical meaning alterations.

In ""Medical history"", ""COPD"" expands to ""Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"" - that's just a full form expansion, not a meaning change. ""Because of"" replaces ""that were caused by"" for esophageal varices - same meaning. 

The ""Treatment course"" has several tweaks: ""No fever"" becomes ""Afebrile"" (medical synonym), ""Inadequate compliance"" becomes ""Medication adherence poor"" (equivalent), and ""antibiotics (Erytromycin)"" specifies what was previously just ""Erytromycin"". That last one catches my attention - adding ""antibiotics"" clarifies Erytromycin's purpose, which feels like a meaningful enhancement. 

""Plan after discharge"" vs ""Discharge plan"" is purely structural. The medications and diagnoses sections are identical. 

So after careful review, only one change stands out as medically meaningful: specifying Erytromycin as an antibiotic in the treatment course. All other alterations are synonymous rephrasings.

- ""antibiotic treatment changed... to cefotaxim"" vs ""antibiotics (Erytromycin)"" - here ""Erytromycin"" is specified as antibiotic type in modified version, which clarifies the previously ambiguous reference. This adds information about the specific antibiotic used prior to gastroscopy.

Medications/Procedures/Diagnoses:
All identical except:
- ""Plan after discharge"" section renamed to ""Discharge plan"" with rephrased but identical referral instructions.

The key meaningful change is in the treatment course where ""Erytromycin"" is explicitly identified as an antibiotic, whereas the original only mentioned ""Erytromycin"" without specifying it was an antibiotic. This clarifies medication classification.

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In **Reason of admission**, the modified version deletes ""Temp 39 degrees Celsius"" - that's a meaningful deletion of a clinical observation.

For **Medical history**, ""diabetes mellitus type 2"" is removed from the modified version. This is significant as it's a chronic condition affecting treatment.

In **Hospital course**, three deletions stand out: 
- The original's ""CRP 279. Leukocytes 16,2. P-Creatinine 137"" lab values are missing
- ""No fever"" is removed
- The follow-up ""CRP 147, leukocytes normalized, P-crea 128"" is deleted
These are all clinically relevant data points.

The **Medications** section loses ""Metformin (Metformin), 500 mg 2+0+2"" - crucial for diabetes management.

**Secondary diagnosis** also removes ""Diabetes mellitus type 2"", consistent with the medical history change.

Other sections like Procedures, Plan after discharge, and Main diagnosis remain identical. Spelling variations like ""diffucluty/diffucluty"" or ""transporatation"" appear in both versions and don't constitute meaningful changes.

That gives us 5 distinct meaningful deletions: temperature, diabetes history, initial/follow-up labs, and metformin prescription. The diabetes removal affects multiple sections but counts as one conceptual change.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two versions of a clinical case where the variation type is ""delete"". 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In **Reason of admission**, the modified version removes ""appearance of redness and"" and ""Temp 39 degrees Celsius."" The temperature deletion is clinically significant as it indicates fever, a key symptom for infection. Redness removal also affects symptom description.

**Medical history** shows ""diabetes mellitus type 2"" deleted. This is a major comorbidity affecting treatment decisions, especially with antibiotics and kidney concerns.

**Hospital course** has multiple deletions: 
- ""swollen... with defined redness"" (clinical sign)
- ""CRP 279. Leukocytes 16,2. P-Creatinine 137"" (critical lab values showing inflammation/renal function)
- ""for suspected erysipelas"" (diagnostic context)
- ""No fever. CRP 147, leukocytes normalized, P-crea 128"" (treatment response metrics)
- Antibiotic switch detail ""Bensylpenicillin... changed to fenoximetylpenicillin"" (treatment modification)

**Medications** removes Metformin, which is directly related to the deleted diabetes history.

**Secondary diagnosis** consistently removes diabetes mellitus type 2.

**Main diagnosis** completely deletes ""A46.9 Erysipelas"" - this is the core medical conclusion.

I'm ignoring minor spelling variations (""diffucluty"" vs ""diffucluty"") and identical sections like Procedures/Plan. Each deletion alters clinical understanding: removing symptoms, comorbidities, lab results, treatment details, and the final diagnosis. That totals 8 distinct meaningful deletions affecting medical meaning.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between the original and modified case reports for medicine_1, ignoring rephrasing or synonymous wording. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

**Reason of admission**: The modified version deletes ""Temp 39 degrees Celsius."" This is a meaningful deletion as it removes a key clinical observation (fever) that supported the infection diagnosis.

**Medical history**: ""Diabetes mellitus type 2"" is removed from the modified version. This is significant because diabetes is a comorbidity affecting infection management and antibiotic choice.

**Hospital course**: 
- Deletion of ""P-Creatinine 137"" in initial findings removes baseline kidney function data. 
- ""No fever"" is deleted from improvement indicators, which is clinically relevant for monitoring infection resolution. 
- The creatinine follow-up value ""P-crea 128"" remains, but the baseline deletion makes this an incomplete dataset.

**Medications**: Metformin (for diabetes) is completely removed from the list. This directly reflects the medical history deletion and impacts treatment accuracy.

**Secondary diagnosis**: Interestingly, diabetes mellitus type 2 remains listed here despite being deleted from medical history and medications. This creates an inconsistency but isn't a direct change to the section itself.

**Other sections** (Procedures, Plan, Diagnoses) show no changes.

Counting only unambiguous medical-impact changes:
1. Admission fever deletion
2. Diabetes history deletion
3. Initial P-Creatinine deletion
4. ""No fever"" deletion in recovery
5. Metformin removal

The secondary diagnosis inconsistency isn't a change to that section's content, so I won't count it. That gives 5 meaningful alterations.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between the original and modified clinical case, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

**Reason of admission:**
- ""a swollen"" → ""a alot swollen"" (intensifier added)
- Removed ""diffucluty walking""
- Added ""shortness of breath""
- Temp changed from 39°C to 36°C (significant clinical difference)

**Medical history:**
- ""chronic kidney disease stage 3"" replaced with ""chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"" (major comorbidity change)

**Hospital course:**
- ""defined redness"" → ""a bit of redness"" (subjective change)
- CRP 279 → 13, leukocytes 16.2 → 8.2 (critical lab value changes)
- Added D-dimer 23.4 mg/l and SpO2 82% (new clinical markers)
- Completely different treatment: antibiotics for erysipelas → Eliquis for DVT
- Ultrasound findings changed from negative to positive for DVT
- Added CT showing pulmonary embolism
- Oxygen therapy added
- Different discharge parameters (SpO2/D-dimer vs CRP/leukocytes)

**Medications:**
- Antibiotics replaced with Eliquis (treatment change)
- Added 6-month duration for anticoagulant

**Plan after discharge:**
- Antibiotics → anticoagulation
- Added follow-up for suspected hereditary disorder

**Diagnoses:**
- Main diagnosis changed from erysipelas (A46.9) to DVT+PE (I80.1/I26.9)
- Secondary: COPD added, CKD removed

Now filtering out non-meaningful changes:
- ""alot swollen"" vs ""swollen"" is just emphasis
- ""a bit of redness"" is descriptive nuance
- ""extremely swollen"" is subjective

Meaningful changes count:
1. Symptom changes (SOB added, walking difficulty removed)
2. Temp discrepancy
3. Comorbidity swap (COPD for CKD)
4. Lab value alterations
5. New findings (D-dimer, SpO2)
6. Different treatment pathway
7. Contrasting ultrasound/CT results
8. Oxygen therapy addition
9. Medication regime change
10. Discharge plan overhaul
11. Follow-up addition
12. Main diagnosis revision
13. Secondary diagnosis modification

That's 13 distinct medical meaning alterations. The core clinical narrative shifted from infection to thromboembolic disease.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes that alter medical meaning between two clinical case versions. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In ""Reason for admission"":
- ""swollen right leg"" changed to ""bit swollen"" - this is a severity modification
- ""difficulty walking"" removed - meaningful deletion
- Temperature decreased from 39°C to 38°C - significant vital sign change

""Hospital course"" has multiple changes:
- Examination findings softened (""not so swollen"", ""not so defined redness"", ""a little pain"")
- Initial CRP and leukocyte values lowered (279→179, 16.2→12.2)
- Antibiotic route changed from IV to oral
- Ultrasound result flipped from negative to positive for DVT - crucial diagnostic change
- Post-treatment CRP value decreased more significantly (147→47)
- Removal of antibiotic switch detail (IV to oral transition)

Medications section adds Eliquis (apixaban) - new anticoagulant therapy

Plan after discharge now includes anticoagulation treatment - major management change

Main diagnosis completely changed from erysipelas (A46.9) to DVT (I80.2) - fundamental diagnostic shift

I'm noting that some changes like ""diffucluty"" to standard spelling don't count, while all vital sign alterations, test result modifications, and treatment/diagnosis changes are medically significant. The DVT finding reversal alone would change clinical management entirely.

The final count should reflect these substantive differences without counting minor wording tweaks. The core medical narrative has shifted from an infection case to a thrombotic event with corresponding treatment adjustments.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between the original and modified clinical case, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason of admission"" shows a subtle change: ""swollen right leg"" becomes ""a bit swollen right leg"" in the modified version. This softens the severity description but doesn't change the core medical fact of swelling presence. 

Moving to ""Hospital course"", I spot three key modifications: 
1) ""swollen right leg with defined redness"" becomes ""not so swollen... with not so defined redness"" - again minimizing severity without contradicting the existence of symptoms
2) ""pain when palpated"" becomes ""a little pain"" - same pattern of downplaying intensity
3) The antibiotic administration changes significantly: original specifies intravenous Bensylpenicillin initially, later switched to oral Fenoximetylpenicillin. The modified version starts directly with oral Fenoximetylpenicillin, omitting the IV phase entirely.

The antibiotic change stands out as medically significant - it alters the treatment pathway. The other modifications are just adjective adjustments that don't change diagnostic or treatment implications. The discharge plan, diagnoses, and medications (except the antibiotic initiation) remain identical.

So I conclude there's exactly one meaningful change: the antibiotic treatment initiation method. The rest are descriptive nuances that don't affect clinical interpretation.

- All clinical values unchanged → no count

**Medications & Procedures:**
- Identical → no count

**Plan after Discharge:**

**Diagnoses:**
- Secondary diagnosis rephrased with synonymous terms (""Essential Hypertension"" is still hypertension)
- Main diagnosis identical

**Spelling Errors:**
- ""diffucluty"" appears in both → not a meaningful change
- ""transporatation"" error persists → not counted

**Conclusion:** Only the DVT abbreviation expansion could be considered a meaningful clarification, but since it's defining an established abbreviation without changing meaning, I won't count it. All other changes are synonyms, rephrasings or non-medical substitutions. Therefore, the count of meaningful changes is zero.

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In History of Presenting Illness, the modified version deletes ""by special care facility staff"" from the discovery scene. This removes information about who found the patient, which doesn't change medical management.

In Past Medical History, ""schizophrenia"" is completely removed. This is significant as it affects care coordination and medication choices (antipsychotics).

The Treatment Course shows multiple deletions:
- Removal of ""suspected on top bacterial infection"" alongside antibiotics prescription
- but later mentions Moraxella growth and antibiotic switch, so the suspicion remains implied.
- Deletion of ""Patient feels better after antibiotics"" - this clinical improvement is meaningful.
- Removal of ""CRP 199, rising initially"" - losing trend data on inflammation marker.
- Omitting ""Patient uses walker...fallen multiple times"" - crucial for fall risk assessment.

Medications section loses Olanzapine 10mg - directly related to the deleted schizophrenia history.

Secondary Diagnosis removes schizophrenia entirely.

Main Diagnosis deletes ""J15.0 Unspecified bacterial pneumonia"" - despite Moraxella findings and antibiotic treatment.

Differential Diagnosis remains unchanged.

Counting these: schizophrenia removal (PMH, meds, secondary Dx), clinical improvement note, CRP trend, fall risk details, and bacterial pneumonia diagnosis deletion. That's 5 distinct meaningful changes affecting patient management.

The bacterial infection suspicion deletion might seem important, but since antibiotics were still given and Moraxella noted, the action remains consistent. So I won't count that separately.

Final count is 5 meaningful alterations.

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

**History of Presenting Illness:**
- Modified version deletes ""by special care facility staff"" from ""Found on the floor..."". This removes information about who found the patient, which could be medically relevant for care context.

**Past Medical History:**
- ""Schizophrenia"" is completely removed. This is a significant deletion affecting psychiatric history and medication considerations.

**Treatment Course:**
Multiple deletions here:
1. Removal of CRP 143 and PCR positive for Influenza A - eliminates key lab confirmations.
2. Omission of Oseltamivir and Cefotaxime administration details - deletes specific treatment info.
3. Missing ""Patient feels better after antibiotics"" - removes treatment response data.
4. Deleted CRP 199 (rising) - excludes worsening inflammation marker.
5. Absence of ""assessed to be due to influenza"" for liver enzymes - removes clinical interpretation.
6. Omitted antibiotic switch details (Cefotaxim to doxycycline) and ID consultant involvement - affects treatment narrative.

**Medications:**
- Olanzapine removed - consistent with schizophrenia deletion in PMH.

**Secondary Diagnosis:**
- Schizophrenia diagnosis deleted.

**Main Diagnosis:**
- Entire diagnosis codes (J10.0 and J15.0) removed - this is a major deletion.

**Other Changes:**
- ""walker use and falls history"" deleted from treatment course - affects mobility assessment.
- ""contstipation"" typo remains in both versions (not a meaningful change).

I'm counting 9 distinct meaningful deletions that alter medical interpretation:

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between the original and modified case, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. In ""History of presenting illness"", the modified version deletes ""by special care facility staff"" from where the patient was found. This removes information about who found him, which seems medically irrelevant to his condition.

Moving to ""Past medical history"", schizophrenia is completely removed from the modified version. This is significant because psychiatric history can influence treatment decisions and fall risk assessment.

In the ""Treatment course"" section, the phrase ""Patient uses walker to mobilise and has fallen multiple times lately"" is deleted. This directly impacts fall risk evaluation and mobility concerns - crucial for geriatric care planning.

The ""Medications"" section shows Olanzapine removed. Since olanzapine treats schizophrenia (deleted from PMH), this medication change aligns with that deletion but still counts as a separate meaningful alteration.

""Secondary diagnosis"" also reflects the schizophrenia deletion. The ICD codes under ""Main diagnosis"" remain identical, and ""Differential diagnosis"" is unchanged.

So summarizing medically significant changes: 
1) Schizophrenia removed from PMH 
2) Mobility/fall history deleted from treatment course 
3) Olanzapine removed from medications 
4) Schizophrenia removed from secondary diagnoses

The special care facility mention seems non-medical. That gives four distinct meaningful alterations affecting clinical picture. Final count should be 4.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between the original and modified clinical case, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The history of presenting illness shows the patient was found ""on the floor by facility staff"" vs ""outside by family"" - this changes the circumstances of discovery but doesn't seem medically significant for diagnosis or treatment. 

In treatment course, three changes jump out: 
1) Initial temp changed from 38.7 to 36.7 (fever vs normal) 
2) Initial CRP from 143 to 43 (significant inflammation difference)
3) Culture finding switched from Moraxella to Klamydia - that's a different pathogen entirely. 

The diagnosis section reflects this with ""unspecified bacterial pneumonia"" becoming ""Klamydia bacterial pneumonia"". These are clinically important changes affecting antibiotic choice and infection control. 

Other modifications like ""contstipation"" typo or oxygen details appear identical. The medication list and discharge plan remain unchanged. 

So we have three core medical alterations: vital signs (temp/CRP), pathogen identification, and resulting diagnosis specificity. That makes three meaningful changes.

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In History of Presenting Illness, the discovery location changes from ""on the floor by facility staff"" to ""outside by family"" - this alters the circumstances of presentation and suggests different safety concerns.

Treatment Course has several key differences:
- Added ""disoriented, hallucinating"" and difficulty examining - new psychiatric symptoms
- Temperature drops from 38.7 to 36.7 (fever vs possible hypothermia)
- CRP plummets from 143 to 3 (significant inflammation marker change)
- Oseltamivir and Cefotaxime administration is removed in modified version
- Bacterial pathogen changes from Moraxella to Klamydia (likely Chlamydia typo)
- Added finding of missed antipsychotics behind bed - crucial medication adherence issue

Plan after discharge now includes continuing Olanzapine - new treatment instruction.

Secondary diagnosis changes ""unspecified bacterial pneumonia"" to ""Klamydia bacterial pneumonia"" - specific pathogen identification.

I note that unchanged elements like medications, nodule follow-up, and most diagnoses aren't counted as they preserve original meaning. The differential diagnosis remains identical.

The temperature discrepancy (38.7 vs 36.7) is particularly significant as it changes febrile status. The CRP drop from 143 to 3 completely alters the inflammation picture. The antipsychotic finding explains the hallucinations and is a critical new risk factor.

After careful review, I identify 7 distinct medical meaning changes across the sections. The pathogen switch, vital sign differences, and psychiatric findings constitute clinically relevant modifications beyond simple rephrasing.

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The header changes like ""History of presenting illness"" to ""Presenting complaint"" seem like synonymous phrasing - both describe the initial symptoms. Similarly, ""Past medical history"" to ""Medical history"" is just a shortening without meaning change. 

Looking at the clinical details: ""suspected influenza"" vs ""most likely influenza"" - this feels significant. ""Suspected"" implies uncertainty while ""most likely"" suggests higher clinical confidence, which could affect diagnostic interpretation. 

The phrase ""found on the floor"" becoming ""discovered on the floor"" is purely synonymous. ""Special care facility staff"" to ""specialcare facility personnel"" is just terminology variation without medical meaning change. 

In medical history, ""smoker"" to ""active smoker"" adds clinical relevance by specifying current smoking status, which impacts COPD management. That's a meaningful addition. 

Treatment course shows several synonym-level changes: ""complains of"" to ""reported experiencing"", ""no findings"" to ""no abnormalities"", ""nodular change"" to ""nodular lesion"". While ""lesion"" is more precise medically, both terms describe the same radiological finding. 

The oxygen saturation description has identical values and context. Medication list is completely unchanged. 

Post-discharge plan changes ""radiological control"" to ""follow-up chest imaging"" - clearer but same intent. ""Procedures: None"" vs ""None performed"" is identical in meaning. 

Diagnosis sections show ""COPD"" expanded to full term in modified version, but this is just spelling out the acronym without changing meaning. 

The key meaningful changes I identify are: 
1. ""suspected"" → ""most likely"" (diagnostic certainty shift) 
2. ""smoker"" → ""active smoker"" (clinical status specification) 

That's two meaningful alterations. Other modifications are either synonymous or stylistic.

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""History of presenting illness"" becomes ""Presenting complaint"" - that's just a label change without medical impact. ""Suspected influenza"" to ""most likely influenza"" is a nuance shift in certainty, but doesn't alter the actual diagnosis. ""Found on the floor"" to ""Discovered on the floor"" is pure synonym replacement.

In ""Past medical history"", ""Advanced COPD, smoker"" becomes ""Advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, active smoker"" - spelling out COPD is clarification, not meaning change. ""Active"" adds detail about smoking status though - that might be significant.

The treatment section shows ""contstipation"" typo in both versions, so no change. All medication details remain identical. The clinical course has one notable change: ""on top bacterial infection"" to ""on top bacterial infection"" - wait, that appears identical? Let me double-check... ah, the original says ""suspected on top bacterial infection"" while modified says ""suspected on top bacterial infection"" - actually identical phrasing. 

Wait, in medical history: ""smoker"" vs ""active smoker"" - that's a meaningful addition specifying current status. Also in presenting complaint: ""suspected"" to ""most likely"" increases diagnostic certainty. 

Other sections (plan, diagnoses, meds) show no changes. So two meaningful changes: smoking status specification and influenza likelihood upgrade. The count should be 2.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between the original and modified clinical case, ignoring synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The header changes from ""History of presenting illness"" to ""Presenting complaint"" - that's just synonymous phrasing. ""Medical history"" instead of ""Past medical history"" is also equivalent. 

Looking at the content: ""suspected influenza"" vs ""most likely influenza"" carries the same clinical uncertainty. ""Found on the floor"" becoming ""Discovered on the floor"" is pure synonym substitution. ""Special care facility staff"" to ""personnel"" is also non-substantive. 

In medical history, ""smoker"" to ""active smoker"" adds a minor detail but doesn't change the core meaning of current smoking status. The treatment course shows ""complains of"" vs ""reported experiencing"" - same meaning. ""No findings"" to ""no abnormalities"" in physical exam is identical clinically. 

The CT finding change from ""nodular change"" to ""nodular lesion"" might seem significant, but in radiology context both describe the same concerning finding requiring follow-up. ""On top bacterial infection"" to ""suspected on top bacterial infection"" actually keeps the original meaning when reading the full sentence. 

Noticing ""dyspnea only when mobilizing"" vs ""during mobilization"" - identical. The transport recommendation change from ""according to recommendations"" to ""as recommended"" is purely syntactic. 

All medication and diagnosis sections are verbatim copies. No alterations in discharge plan or procedures. 

The only potential meaningful change is ""active smoker"" specifying current status, but since the original ""smoker"" implies current habit in medical contexts, I consider this non-essential. All other changes are synonymous rephrasings that maintain identical clinical meaning. 

Therefore, after thorough comparison, I conclude there are zero meaningful medical meaning changes.

First, I'll systematically compare each section of the original and modified texts. Starting with ""Reason for admission"", I notice the modified version removes ""and vomiting"" from the symptoms. That's a deletion of a symptom, which seems medically relevant.

Moving to ""Medical history"", the modified text omits ""Appendectomy as a child"" and ""Biopsy showed chronic ileitis in January"". Both are significant deletions - one about surgical history and another about diagnostic findings.

In ""Hospital course"", the modified version deletes ""vomiting"" from the worsening symptoms and removes ""due to nausea and vomiting"" when describing eating troubles. Also, ""sever"" is changed to just ""abdominal pain"" - but since ""sever"" was likely a typo for ""severe"", this might be a correction rather than a deletion. The core symptom ""abdominal pain"" remains.

The rest of the document appears identical: medications, discharge plan, procedures, diagnoses all match. No changes in differentials or secondary diagnoses.

So the meaningful deletions are: vomiting (twice), appendectomy history, and chronic ileitis biopsy result. That makes four distinct medical deletions. I won't count the ""sever"" change as it doesn't alter medical meaningfully.

- CRP down to 29 outcome removed  
That's four meaningful deletions.

**Secondary Diagnosis**  
Constipation diagnosis removed - one deletion.

**Differential Diagnosis**  
Celiac disease and gastroenteritis removed - two deletions.

**Unchanged Elements**  
Medications, procedures, and plan after discharge remain identical. The remaining abdominal pain descriptions, test results (LPK, liver enzymes), and admission reasons are preserved in meaning.

Total count: 2 (admission) + 2 (history) + 4 (hospital course) + 1 (secondary Dx) + 2 (diff Dx) = 11 meaningful deletions. I'll verify if any deletions could be considered non-meaningful rephrasing, but all seem clinically significant - like removing vomiting symptoms and diagnostic possibilities.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between the original and modified clinical case, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason for admission"" in the modified version deletes ""constipation for 4 days and vomiting"" - that's two distinct symptom removals. 

In ""Medical history"", the modified version omits ""Appendectomy as a child"" and truncates the January admission details by removing ""due to abdominal pain. Biopsy showed chronic ileitis in January"" - that's three deletions: the appendectomy, admission reason, and biopsy result. 

The ""Hospital course"" section has multiple changes: ""sever"" corrected to standard ""severe"" is just spelling, not meaningful. But they removed ""vomiting"" after nausea, deleted the CT scan finding of ileitis, and omitted ""and vomiting"" from the worsening symptoms. That's three more meaningful deletions. 

Other sections like medications and diagnoses appear identical. The constipation deletion in admission seems contradicted by its retention in secondary diagnoses - but since we're counting changes regardless of consistency, I'll count the admission deletion. 

Total meaningful deletions: 2 (admission) + 3 (history) + 3 (hospital course) = 8. The spelling fix and unchanged sections don't counted. The user emphasized counting deletions that alter medical content, so these 8 omissions qualify.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between two versions of a clinical case, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason for admission"" is identical - no changes there. In ""Medical history"", the original mentions ""Appendectomy as a child"" and ""Biopsy showed chronic ileitis"", while modified says ""Stomach pain issues as a child"" and ""Biopsy with no finds"". That's two clear medical meaning changes: surgical history altered and biopsy results contradicted.

Moving to ""Hospital course"", the CT scan finding changes from ""signs of ileitis"" to ""no findings"", and admission reason shifts from specific ""terminal ileitis"" to vague ""stomach pain and constipation"". The gastroscopy result changes from ""Shows duodenopathy"" to ""Negative"" - that's three more substantive changes. 

Other sections like medications, plan, procedures and diagnoses appear identical. The differential diagnosis still misspells ""Crohn's"" as ""Chrons"" in both versions, but since it's unchanged, I won't count it.

So total meaningful changes: Medical history (2 changes) + Hospital course (3 changes) = 5 alterations that impact clinical understanding. The rest are either identical or non-substantive rewordings.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasing that doesn't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason for admission"" is identical - no changes there. In ""Medical history"", the original mentions appendectomy and chronic ileitis biopsy, while the modified version says ""stomach pain issues"" and ""biopsy with no finds"". That's two meaningful changes: surgical history removal and biopsy result alteration.

Moving to ""Hospital course"", several critical changes jump out: 
- Lab values: LPK from 8.9 to 22.9, CRP from 49 to 249, plus new fever of 40.5
- Imaging: CT now shows appendicitis instead of ileitis
- Treatment: Added emergency appendectomy, blood cultures, antibiotics
- Gastroscopy result changed to ""negative""

The ""Main diagnosis"" shifts from abdominal pain (R104X) to acute appendicitis (K35) - that's clearly significant. Medications now include Cefoxitin post-surgery. 

I'm noting that some elements like discharge plan, procedures, and secondary diagnoses remain unchanged. The differential diagnosis section is identical too. 

After careful review, I count 8 distinct medical meaning changes: 
1-2. Medical history alterations 
3-5. Abnormal lab additions (LPK, CRP, fever) 
6. CT finding change 
7. Added surgery 
8. Main diagnosis revision 
9. New antibiotic 
The gastroscopy result change makes 10, but wait - ""negative"" vs original duodenopathy might be contradictory. That's significant. 

Final count is 10 meaningful changes affecting clinical interpretation.

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

**Medical History:**
- Original mentions ""Appendectomy as a child"" and ""Biopsy showed chronic ileitis""
- Modified changes this to ""Stomach pain issues as a child"" (deletion of appendectomy) and ""Biopsy with no finds"" (contradicts original ileitis finding)
→ 2 meaningful changes

**Hospital Course:**
- Lab values: LPK from 8.9 to 18.9, CRP from 49 to 149 (significant inflammation markers)
- Added ""Fever 38.5"" (new clinical symptom)
- CT finding changed from ""ileitis"" to ""appendicitis""
- Admission reason changed from ""terminal ileitis"" to ""stomach pain, conservative therapy""
- Gastroscopy result changed from ""shows duodenopathy"" to ""Negative""
→ 5 meaningful changes

**Main Diagnosis:**
- Changed from ""R104X Abdominal pain"" to ""K35 Acute appendicitis""
→ 1 meaningful change

Other sections (Reason for admission, Medications, Plan, Procedures, Secondary diagnoses, Differential diagnoses) show no medically significant changes - only minor phrasing differences.

Total count: 2 (history) + 5 (hospital course) + 1 (diagnosis) = 8 meaningful changes. I'll verify this by double-checking that all modifications alter clinical interpretation, like the appendectomy deletion changing surgical history or the CT/lab changes suggesting different pathologies.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between two clinical case versions, ignoring synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason for admission"" changes ""man"" to ""male"" and ""after"" to ""following"" - these are synonyms with identical meaning. ""Medical history"" is completely identical. 

In ""Hospital course"", several changes catch my attention: 
- ""Patient had"" becomes ""Patient reported"" - this subtly shifts from objective observation to subjective reporting, which could be medically significant. 
- ""SR"" expands to ""sinus rhythm"" - while clearer, it's the same medical concept. 
- ""with signs of"" changes to ""indicating"" - synonymous phrasing. 
- ""ward"" becomes ""unit"" - no medical meaning change. 
- ""because of"" to ""because of"" (wait, actually ""because of"" remains? No, in ""Admitted... because of signs"" vs ""because of terminal ileitis signs"" - still equivalent. 
- ""after that"" to ""thereafter"" - synonym. 
- ""Culture from stool recommended"" vs ""Stool culture advised"" - identical meaning. 
- ""Patient gets better"" becomes ""Clinical improvement"" - the latter is more professional but same meaning. 

The medication list is identical. ""Plan after discharge"" vs ""Discharge plan"" - same meaning. Procedures and diagnoses sections show only one change: ""Main diagnosis"" becomes ""Primary diagnosis"" - synonymous in medical context. 

The differential diagnosis changes ""Chrons"" to ""Chrons disease"" - this is actually a correction of a misspelling (should be Crohn's) but since both versions use ""Chrons"", it's likely just inconsistent spelling rather than meaningful change. 

So the only potential meaningful change is ""had"" vs ""reported"" for abdominal pain. This shifts from clinician's observation to patient's subjective report, which could affect interpretation. All other changes are synonyms, rephrasings or corrections without medical impact. 

Therefore, the count of meaningful changes is 1.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two clinical case versions while ignoring synonymous rephrasing. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Reason for admission"" changes ""man"" to ""male"" and ""after referral"" to ""following a referral"" - these are synonyms with identical medical implications. 

In ""Hospital course"", I spot three potential changes: 
1. ""had sever abdominal pain"" becomes ""reported sever abdominal pain"" - this shifts from objective observation to patient report, altering clinical perspective. 
2. ""ECG with SR"" expands to ""sinus rhythm"" - clarifies the abbreviation but doesn't change meaning. 
3. ""CT... with signs"" becomes ""indicating"" - synonymous phrasing. 

The first change stands out as meaningful because it modifies how the pain information was obtained (clinician observed vs patient reported), which could affect interpretation. The other sections (medications, diagnoses, etc.) show no changes. 

Noting that ""constpation"" misspelling persists in both versions, so it's not a differential change. The single meaningful alteration is in pain documentation method, making the final count 1.

Moving to ""Hoitojakso"", I notice three key deletions: 
1) The removal of ""rigiditeetti Parkinsonin taudille tyypillinen"" from neurological findings
2) Omission of ""Neuromuskulaarista etiologiaa ei ole löytynyt"" 
3) Missing ""Madopark"" medication for Parkinson's in the ""Lääkitys"" section

The ""Diagnoosit"" section also deletes ""Parkinsonin tauti"" entirely. These aren't rephrasings - they're substantive removals that alter the patient's clinical picture by eliminating Parkinson's diagnosis and related findings. 

The HIV-related content and hemolytic anemia details remain unchanged, so those don't counted. Final count is 4 meaningful deletions affecting medical meaning.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish clinical cases where Parkinson's disease information was deleted. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Hoidon syy"" and ""Esitiedot"" show Parkinson's removal in preconditions - that's one clear deletion. In ""Hoitojakso"", I notice three key removals: the HIV diagnosis/treatment details, Parkinson-specific neurological findings (rigiditeetti), and the question about HIV explaining neurological symptoms. 

The ""Lääkitys"" section loses two Parkinson medications (Madopark and HIV drugs Tivicay/Truvada) - that's two more deletions. ""Diagnoosit"" removes Parkinson's diagnosis, and ""Päädiagnoosi"" deletes the entire HIV diagnosis code.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case versions. I need to focus only on alterations that affect medical meaning, ignoring rephrasings or synonyms that keep the same meaning. The response should be just a number.

First, I'll compare the sections systematically. Starting with ""Hoidon syy"" (Reason for treatment), both versions are identical - no changes there.

In ""Esitiedot"" (Background), the modified version deletes ""Parkinsonin tauti"" (Parkinson's disease). This is a significant medical deletion as it removes a chronic neurological condition from the patient's history.

Moving to ""Hoitojakso"" (Treatment period): 
- ""Keuhkovaltimoiden TT:ssä ei todettu keuhkoemboliaa tai perikardiaalista nestettä"" becomes shortened to ""Keuhkovaltimoiden TT"" - deleting the negative findings for pulmonary embolism and pericardial fluid. This removes important diagnostic information.
- The mention of unprotected sex leading to fever/rash is deleted, which removes context for HIV testing.
- HIV-positive test result and HIV medication initiation (Truvada/Tivicay) are completely removed.
- The hemolytic anemia finding and hematology consult are deleted.
- Neurological exam loses ""rigiditeetti Parkinsonin taudille tyypillinen"" (rigidity typical for Parkinson's) - but since Parkinson's was already deleted in background, this might be consistent though it removes a symptom description.
- The question about neurological symptoms possibly relating to HIV infection is deleted.
- ""Voisivatko neurologiset oireet selittyä HIV-infektiolla?"" is deleted - removing a diagnostic consideration.

In ""Lääkitys"" (Medications): 
- Madopark (for Parkinson's) and HIV drugs (Tivicay/Truvada) are removed. This directly reflects deleted diagnoses.

For ""Suunnitelma"" (Plan): 
- The infectious disease follow-up is deleted, consistent with HIV removal.

In ""Diagnoosit"" (Diagnoses): 
- Parkinson's disease and D59.9 hemolytic anemia are removed.
- The ""Päädiagnoosi"" section is completely blank in modified version versus original's HIV and anemia diagnoses.

Counting only meaningful medical changes: 
1. Deletion of Parkinson's in background 
2. Deletion of PE/pericardial fluid findings 
3. Deletion of unprotected sex context 
4. Deletion of HIV+ status 
5. Deletion of HIV medication initiation 
6. Deletion of hemolytic anemia finding 
7. Deletion of HIV-anemia diagnostic question 
8. Removal of Parkinson's medication 
9. Removal of HIV medications 
10. Removal of infectious disease follow-up 
11. Removal of Parkinson's from diagnoses 
12. Removal of hemolytic anemia diagnosis 
13. Complete removal of main diagnosis (HIV and anemia)

That's 13 meaningful changes. I should verify nothing is double-counted. The medication and diagnosis removals are direct consequences of condition deletions, but since they're explicit removals in different sections, they count as separate meaningful changes. No synonyms or rephrasings here - all are substantive deletions affecting patient's medical picture.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasing that doesn't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. In ""Esitiedot"", the modified version replaces ""Verenpainetauti"" and ""syyvä laskimotukos"" with ""Diabetes mellitus tyyppi 2"" and ""Aivohalvaus"" - that's two clear medical changes. 

Moving to ""Hoitojakso"", the modified version introduces new elements: drug use details, needle injections, hepatitis vaccination status, and positive hepatitis B test. It also changes the neurological symptom speculation from HIV to sepsis. That's five additional meaningful changes. 

The ""Lääkitys"" section adds ""Entekaviiri"" medication - one change. ""Suunnitelma"" now includes ""hyytymishäiriö"" follow-up - another change. ""Diagnoosit"" adds ""Sepsis"" and ""Akuutti hepatiitti B"" - two more changes. 

The ""Päädiagnoosi"" adds hepatitis B ICD code while keeping others identical. Since ICD codes are diagnostic, this counts as one change. 

Tallying these: 2 (esitiedot) + 5 (hoitojakso) + 1 (lääkitys) + 1 (suunnitelma) + 2 (diagnoosit) + 1 (päädiagnoosi) = 12 meaningful changes. I'll verify by rechecking each modification against the original to ensure no overlaps or trivial wording differences were counted.

Hmm, tässä on tehtävä, jossa minun tulee laskea merkitykselliset muutokset kahden kliinisen tapauksen välillä. Tapaukset ovat suomeksi, ja minun pitää keskittyä vain muutoksiin, jotka muuttavat lääketieteellistä merkitystä. En saa huomioida uudelleenmuotoiluja tai synonyymeja, jos ne säilyttävät alkuperäisen merkityksen.

Alun perin tarkastelen molempia versioita. Molemmat alkavat samalla ""Hoidon syy"" -kohdalla: 69-vuotias mies tulee osastolle hengenahdistuksen takia Espanjan-matkan jälkeen. Tässä ei ole muutoksia.

""Esitiedot"" -kohdassa on kuitenkin merkittäviä eroja. Alkuperäisessä on Parkinsonin tauti, verenpainetauti ja molemminpuolinen syvä laskimotukos. Muokatussa versiossa on Parkinsonin tauti, diabetes mellitus tyyppi 2 ja aivohalvaus. Tämä on selvä muutos: verenpainetauti ja DVT poistettu, ja tilalle tuli diabetes ja aivohalvaus. Tämä muuttaa potilaan taustaa täysin, joten se on merkityksellinen muutos.

""Hoitojakso"" -kohdassa on useita muutoksia. Alkuperäisessä on hypoksia ja anemia, ja potilas kertoo suojaamattomasta seksistä, kuumetta ja ihottumaa. Muokatussa versiossa lisätään huumeiden käyttö ja pistokset, ei hepatiittirokotuksia, ja HIV-testin lisäksi hepatiitti B positiivinen. Myös neurologisten oireiden selitys muuttuu HIV-infektiosta sepsikseen. Lopuksi happisaturaatio on 84% vs. alkuperäinen 94%, ja potilas siirretään teho-osastolle antibioottihoidon vuoksi. Nämä kaikki muuttavat kliinistä tilannetta, joten ne ovat merkityksellisiä.

""Lääkitys"" -kohdassa alkuperäisessä on HIV-lääkkeet Truvada ja Tivicay. Muokatussa versiossa ne ovat edelleen mukana, mutta lisätään Entekaviiri hepatiitti B:hen ja Kefuroksiimi sepsiksen hoitoon. Tämä on uusi lääkitys, joka liittyy uusiin diagnooseihin, joten se on merkityksellinen muutos.

""Suunnitelma"" -kohdassa alkuperäisessä on jatkot infektio- ja neurologisella poliklinikalla. Muokatussa versiossa lisätään hyytymishäiriöpoliklinikka, intensiivinen fysioterapia ja hoitotarpeiden kartoitus. Tämä heijastaa uusia hoitopaineita, joten se on muutos.

""Diagnoosit"" -kohdassa alkuperäisessä on Parkinson, hypertensio ja DVT. Muokatussa versiossa on lisäksi sepsis, ja DVT on edelleen mukana, mutta hypertensio on poistettu? Ei, molemmissa on hypertensio ja DVT, mutta muokattu lisää sepsiksen. Ja päädiagnoosit muuttuvat: alkuperäisessä on HIV ja hemolyyttinen anemia, muokatussa on septikemia, HIV ja akuutti hepatiitti B. Tämä on suuri muutos diagnooseissa.

Lasken nyt kaikki nämä muutokset. Esitiedoissa yksi iso muutos. Hoitojaksossa useita: huumeiden käyttö, hepatiitti B, sepsiksen epäily, happisaturaation lasku ja teho-osastosiirto. Lääkityksessä kaksi uutta lääkettä. Suunnitelmassa lisäykset. Diagnooseissa sepsis ja hepatiitti B lisätty, ja päädiagnoosit muuttuneet. Yhteensä minun pitäisi laskea nämä erikseen, mutta tehtävässä sanotaan ""count only meaningful changes"", joten jokainen erillinen muutos, joka muuttaa merkitystä.

Katsotaanpa systemaattisesti:

1. Esitiedot: Taustatiedot muuttuneet kokonaan (3 poistoa/3 lisäystä, mutta lasketaan yhtenä merkittävänä muutoksena, koska koko osio on erilainen).

2. Hoitojakso:
   - Lisätty huumeiden käyttö ja pistokset
   - Lisätty hepatiitti B -testi positiivinen
   - Muutettu neurologisten oireiden selitys HIV:stä sepsikseen
   - Muutettu happisaturaatio 94% -> 84% ja teho-osastolle siirto
   - (Myös ""ei hepatiitirokotuksia"" on uusi, mutta se liittyy hepatiittiin, joten ehkä osa samaa muutosta)

3. Lääkitys: Lisätty kaksi uutta lääkettä (Entekaviiri ja Kefuroksiimi)

4. Suunnitelma: Lisätty hyytymishäiriöpoliklinikka, fysioterapia ja hoitotarpeiden kartoitus

5. Diagnoosit:
   - Päälisätty sepsis diagnooseihin
   - Päädiagnoosit muuttuneet: hemolyyttinen anemia poistettu, septikemia ja hepatiitti B lisätty

Tässä on useita erillisiä muutoksia. Lasken ne:

- Esitietojen muutos: 1 (kokonaisvaltainen muutos)
- Hoitojakson muutokset: huumeet/hepatiitti B (1), sepsiksen epäily (1), happi/teho-osasto (1) – kolme muutosta
- Lääkityksen muutos: kaksi uutta lääkettä (1 muutos, koska ne liittyvät uusiin diagnooseihin)
- Suunnitelman muutos: lisäykset (1)
- Diagnoosien muutos: sepsis lisätty, päädiagnoosit muuttuneet (1-2 muutosta? Mutta lasken kokonaisuutena)

Parempi laskea jokainen erillinen asia, joka muuttaa potilaan tilaa tai hoitoa. Esimerkiksi:

1. Taustat: Diabetes ja aivohalvaus lisätty, verenpainetauti ja DVT poistettu – tämä on yksi suuri muutos, mutta se voi olla useita. Tehtävässä sanotaan ""count changes"", joten ehkä jokainen lisäys/poisto. Mutta DVT on edelleen diagnooseissa myöhemmin, joten se ei poistunut kokonaan. Alkuperäisissä esitiedoissa DVT mainitaan, ja diagnooseissa se on. Muokatussa esitiedoissa ei DVT:tä, mutta diagnooseissa on. Joten esitiedoista DVT poistettu, mutta se on edelleen diagnoosissa. Tämä on hieman sekavaa.

Tarkemmin: alkuperäisissä esitiedoissa ""Molemminpuolinen syvä laskimotukos"", joka on DVT. Muokatussa on ""Aivohalvaus"". Diagnooseissa molemmissa on DVT listattuna. Joten esitiedoissa DVT korvattu aivohalvauksella. Tämä on yksi muutos.

Samoin verenpainetauti vs. diabetes – kaksi eri asiaa.

Joten esitiedoissa:
- Verenpainetauti poistettu
- DVT korvattu aivohalvauksella
- Diabetes lisätty
Tämä on kolme muutosta? Mutta DVT:n poisto ja aivohalvauksen lisäys on kaksi eri asiaa.

Tehtävänannon mukaan: ""additions, deletions, or modifications that alter the medical meaning"". Joten:
- Poisto: verenpainetauti
- Poisto: DVT esitiedoista (vaikka se on diagnooseissa, se poistettiin esitiedoista)
- Lisäys: diabetes
- Lisäys: aivohalvaus
Eli neljä muutosta esitiedoissa? Mutta se tuntuu liialliselta, kos"

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasing that doesn't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. In ""Esitiedot"" (Background), the original mentions ""Verenpainetauti"" (hypertension) and ""molemminpuolinen syvä laskimotukos"" (bilateral deep vein thrombosis), while the modified version replaces these with ""Diabetes mellitus tyyppi 2"" (type 2 diabetes) and ""Aivohalvaus"" (stroke). That's two clear changes - one condition swapped for another, and DVT replaced by stroke.

Moving to ""Hoitojakso"" (Treatment Period), the key difference is in the neurological symptom speculation: original questions if symptoms relate to HIV, while modified suggests ""sepsikselle"" (sepsis). This changes the diagnostic consideration meaningfully. 

In ""Suunnitelma"" (Plan), the modified version adds ""hyytymishäiriö"" (coagulation disorder) to follow-up clinics. Since this wasn't in original plan, it counts as an addition.

Finally, in ""Diagnoosit"" (Diagnoses), ""Sepsis"" is added as the first diagnosis in the modified version, which significantly alters the clinical picture. The ICD codes remain unchanged.

Notable that HIV-related treatments and anemia diagnosis stay consistent, and medication list is identical. The hemolytic anemia discussion remains too. 

So total meaningful alterations: Background (2 changes), Treatment Period speculation (1), Plan addition (1), Diagnoses addition (1). That makes five distinct medical meaning changes.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish clinical case versions, ignoring synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Hoidon syy"" vs ""Hoitoon hakeutumisen syy"" change seems purely linguistic - both mean ""reason for treatment"". Similarly, ""matka Espanjaan jälkeen"" replaces ""Espanjan-matkan jälkeen"" with identical meaning about the Spain trip timing.

In ""Esitiedot"", ""Verenpainetauti"" remains unchanged, and ""DVT"" in diagnoses becomes ""Syvä laskimotukos"" in modified - but since DVT is the abbreviation for deep vein thrombosis, this is just spelling out the acronym. 

The ""Hoitojakso"" to ""Osastojakso"" header change is notable - ""treatment period"" vs ""ward period"" could imply different care phases. Then I spot ""EF"" replacing ""ejektiofraktio"" (ejection fraction abbreviation), ""ei vittausta infektiosta"" vs original's ""ei infektioon viittavaa"" (both mean no infection signs), and ""positiiinen HIV-testissä"" with a typo versus ""HIV-testi positiivinen"". 

The medication section ""Kotilääkitys"" now specifies ""home medication"" versus original's general ""Lääkitys"", which might indicate discharge context. ""Antiviraalisesti hoidosta"" adds ""antivirally treated"" nuance to HIV drugs. ""Elektromyografia"" is the full term for EMG - no meaning change. 

""Suunnitelma"" changes phrasing about follow-up clinics but keeps the same referral intent. Finally, ""Primaaridiagnoosi"" is just Finnish for ""Päädiagnoosi"" (main diagnosis).

The meaningful changes I count are: 1) Hoitojakso→Osastojakso (care phase shift), 2) Kotilääkitys specification, 3) Added ""antivirally treated"" descriptor, and 4) The HIV test phrasing alteration. Other changes are synonyms/typos without medical impact. So four meaningful changes total.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish clinical case versions, ignoring synonymous rephrasing. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. ""Hoidon syy"" vs ""Hoitoon hakeutumisen syy"" is just grammatical adjustment - no medical impact. ""Espanjan-matkan jälkeen"" becoming ""matka Espanjaan jälkeen"" is a prepositional variation that doesn't change meaning.

In the clinical course section, ""Hoitojakso"" to ""Osastojakso"" is notable - the latter specifically indicates ward admission period, which might imply a different care context. Then ""EF"" replaces ""ejektiofraktio"" - this abbreviation could be ambiguous if not universally recognized. ""Ei infektioon viittavaa"" vs ""ei vittausta infektiosta"" uses different negation structures but identical meaning. 

The HIV-test reporting shifts from nominal (""HIV-testi positiivinen"") to adjectival (""Positiiinen HIV-testissä"") phrasing - clinically equivalent. The antiviral treatment description adds ""antiviraalisesti"" which emphasizes the treatment type without changing facts. ""Sen lisänä"" replacing ""Lisäksi"" for fasciculations is purely syntactic. 

""EMG tehty"" substituting ""Elektromyografia tehty"" expands the abbreviation - actually helpful for clarity since EMG isn't defined earlier. 

All other elements - lab values, medications, diagnoses - remain identical. The ICD codes are unchanged too. 

So counting only meaning-altering modifications: 1) Hoitojakso→Osastojakso (care phase specification), 2) EF abbreviation (potential ambiguity), 3) EMG expansion (added clarity). That's three meaningful changes. The antiviral adverb and HIV-test phrasing feel like stylistic choices without clinical impact.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between the original and modified Finnish clinical case, ignoring synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In ""Hoidon syy"" vs ""Hoitoon hakeutumisen syy"": 
- ""Hakeutumisen"" is just a synonym for ""hoito"" in this context - no meaning change.

In ""Hoitojakso"":
- ""EF"" replaces ""ejektiofraktio"" - common medical abbreviation, same meaning.
- ""ei vittausta infektiosta"" vs ""ei infektioon viittavaa"" - synonymous phrasing.
- ""Positiiinen HIV-testissä"" has a typo (""positiiinen"") but clearly means ""positiivinen"" - insignificant.
- All other content matches exactly.

The rest (Lääkitys, Suunnitelma, Diagnoosit, Päädiagnoosi) are identical. 

No medical parameters, findings or conclusions are altered. The neurological observations, test results, and treatment plans remain unchanged. Even the HIV-related information conveys identical clinical significance despite minor wording differences.

Therefore, zero meaningful medical changes exist - just linguistic variations that maintain the original clinical narrative.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case versions. I need to focus only on alterations that affect medical meaning, ignoring rephrasing or synonyms that keep the same meaning.

Looking at the ""Hoidon syy"" section: The original mentions ""vatsakivun ja kuukauden ajan jatkuneen keltaisuuden vuoksi"" while the modified version has ""vatsakivun kuukauden jatkuneen vuoksi"" - deletion of ""keltaisuus"" (jaundice) is medically significant as it removes a key symptom.

In ""Esitiedot"": The original includes ""Alkholin runsas liikakäyttö, retkahdus joulukuussa"" which is completely deleted in the modified version. This removes information about alcohol abuse history and relapse, which is clinically relevant.

In ""Hoitojakso"": 
- ""Iho ja sidekalvot selvästi ikteriset"" is deleted - this confirms jaundice observation, so its removal matters.
- ""Glasgowin alkoholihepatiittipisteet"" becomes ""Glasgowin hepatiittipisteet"" - removing ""alkoholi"" changes the specificity of the scoring system.
- ""uutena oireena voimakasta kutinaa ja vatsakipua"" becomes just ""vatsakipua"" - deletion of intense itching (pruritus) is medically significant.
- ""Aloitettu prednisoloni dekompensoituneen alkoholihepatiitin"" becomes ""dekompensoituneen hepatiitin"" - removing ""alkoholi"" makes the hepatitis cause nonspecific.
- The modified version deletes the bilirubin value improvement (""Bilirubiini laskenut arvoon 290"") which is important lab data.

In ""Toissijaiset diagnoosit"": ""Anorexia nervosa"" is deleted from secondary diagnoses.

In ""Päädiagnoosi"": ""K70.1 Alkoholimaksatulehdus"" becomes ""K70.1 Maksatulehdus"" - removing the alcohol-specific designation.

I count 7 distinct deletions that alter medical meaning: 
1. Jaundice in admission reason
2. Alcohol abuse history
3. Jaundice observation
4. Alcohol-specific Glasgow score
5. Pruritus symptom
6. Alcohol-specific hepatitis diagnosis in treatment
7. Anorexia nervosa diagnosis
8. Alcohol-specific main diagnosis
9. Missing bilirubin improvement data

The bilirubin deletion seems like one more meaningful change. That makes 9 meaningful changes. I'll go with that count.

Looking at the ""Hoidon syy"" section: The original mentions ""vatsakivun ja kuukauden ajan jatkuneen keltaisuuden vuoksi"" while the modified version says ""vatsakivun kuukauden jatkuneen vuoksi"". The deletion of ""ja keltaisuuden"" (and jaundice) removes a key symptom - this is a meaningful change.

In ""Hoitojakso"": 
- The modified version removes ""Iho ja sidekalvot selvästi ikteriset"" (clearly icteric skin and mucous membranes). This deletion of jaundice observation is medically significant.
- It also deletes ""voimakasta kutinaa"" (severe itching) as a new symptom - another meaningful removal.
- Later, ""Bilirubiini laskenut arvoon 290 (alkuarvo 680)"" is deleted from the modified text. This bilirubin level change is important clinical data.

Other changes seem insignificant: 
- ""Alkholin"" typo appears in both versions.
- ""Kylkiikaaren"" typo is present in both.
- Medication and diagnosis sections appear identical.

I count three meaningful deletions: jaundice as admission reason, icteric observation, itching symptom, and bilirubin values. That's four distinct medical information removals. The response should be just the number 4.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between two clinical case versions in Finnish, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In ""Hoidon syy"", the modified version deletes ""ja keltaisuuden"" from the admission reason. Since jaundice is a key clinical sign, this removal meaningfully reduces diagnostic information.

The ""Esitiedot"" section shows three deletions: anorexia nervosa diagnosis, history of heavy alcohol use with December relapse, and the specific sobriety start date. Removing anorexia nervosa eliminates a significant comorbidity, while deleting alcohol history obscures important context for the liver condition.

Moving to ""Hoitojakso"", I notice multiple alterations:
- Removal of ""ikteriset"" (jaundice) skin observation weakens clinical documentation
- ""Glasgowin alkoholihepatiittipisteet"" becoming just ""hepatiittipisteet"" loses the alcohol-specific scoring context
- Deletion of ""voimakasta kutinaa"" (severe itching) omits a symptom potentially related to liver disease
- ""Aloitettu prednisoloni dekompensoituneen alkoholihepatiitin"" is shortened to just ""hepatiitin"", removing the alcohol-related etiology
- The entire episode about bloody vomiting and subsequent medications (glypressin/Nexium) is missing, which is a major clinical deterioration event
- Gastroskopia details about suspected bleeding and red patches are absent
- The bilirubin improvement note (680→290) is deleted, removing important lab trend data

In diagnosis sections:
- ""Toissijaiset diagnoosit"" loses anorexia nervosa and GI bleeding history
- ""Päädiagnoosi"" changes from specific ""Alkoholimaksatulehdus"" to generic ""Maksatulehdus""

Each deletion either removes comorbidities, symptom details, treatment responses, or diagnostic specificity. I count 12 distinct meaningful reductions in medical information across these sections.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful medical changes between two Finnish clinical cases. Let me carefully compare these case reports.

First looking at ""Hoidon syy"": The jaundice duration changed from ""kuukauden"" (month) to ""6 kuukauden"" (6 months). That's clinically significant as prolonged jaundice suggests different etiologies.

In ""Esitiedot"": The original had ""Ruoansulatuskanavan verenvuoto"" (GI bleed) which got replaced with ""GERD"" (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Also the specific cause ""ruokatorven suonikohjuista"" (esophageal varices) was deleted. Major diagnostic change.

The ""Hoitojakso"" section has multiple alterations:
- Inflammatory markers CRP changed from 51 to 5, leukocytes from 13.5 to 11.5
- Significant addition of ""TT vatsa"" (abdominal CT) finding a 6x5cm suspected gallbladder tumor with biopsy
- Alcohol hepatitis treatment (prednisolone) replaced with oxynorm for pain
- New event: patient found intoxicated with 2.5‰ BAC
- Discharge outcome changed from planned discharge to absconding (""katoaa osastolta"")

""Päädiagnoosi"" completely changed from alcoholic hepatitis (K70.1) to gallbladder cancer (C22.1). The follow-up plan also redirects from gastroenterology to oncology due to the tumor suspicion.

The absconding detail with false contact information adds new social complexity. All these changes fundamentally alter the clinical narrative from an alcohol-related liver case to a potential malignancy case with compliance issues.

I count 8 distinct meaningful changes that affect diagnosis, management, and prognosis.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case versions. I need to focus only on alterations that change medical meaning, ignoring rephrasing or synonyms that keep the same meaning.

Looking at ""Hoidon syy"" (Reason for Treatment): The jaundice duration changed from ""kuukauden"" (one month) to ""6 kuukauden"" (six months). This is a significant change in symptom timeline.

In ""Esitiedot"" (Background): ""Ruoansulatuskanavan verenvuoto... suonikohjuista"" was replaced with ""GERD"" (gastroesophageal reflux disease). This swaps a specific past bleeding event for a chronic condition. Also, the detailed cause of bleeding was removed entirely.

For ""Hoitojakso"" (Treatment Period): Multiple critical changes appear. Lab values: CRP dropped from 51 to 5, leukocytes from 13.5 to 11.5, ALAT from 1.61 to 2.61. A new suspected 6x5cm tumor in bile duct was added with biopsy. Prednisolon initiation for hepatitis was replaced with Oxynorm for pain. The Glasgow score mention disappeared. The follow-up plan shifted from gastroenterology to oncology due to suspected malignancy.

""Suunnitelma"" (Plan) now directs to oncology instead of gastroenterology, reflecting the tumor suspicion.

Other sections like medications and secondary diagnoses remain identical. The core diagnosis (K70.1) stays, but the clinical narrative now centers on potential cancer rather than just alcoholic hepatitis.

I count these meaningful changes: 
1) Jaundice duration extension 
2) Background condition swap (bleeding event → GERD) 
3) Four altered lab values (CRP, leukocytes, ALAT, plus Glasgow score removal) 
4) Tumor addition with biopsy 
5) Medication change (prednisolon → Oxynorm) 
6) Follow-up plan redirection 
7) Rationale for oncology referral

That's 7 distinct medical meaning alterations. Formatting tweaks and unchanged elements don't count. The response should be just the number.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case reports. I need to focus only on modifications that alter medical meaning, ignoring rephrasings or synonyms that keep the same meaning.

Looking at the ""Hoidon syy"" section, the jaundice duration changed from ""kuukauden"" (one month) to ""6 kuukauden"" (six months). This is a significant change in symptom duration that could indicate different disease progression.

In ""Hoitojakso,"" I notice two key modifications: ALAT value changed from 1.61 to 2.61, which is a laboratory value alteration. More importantly, there's an addition about a suspected 6x5cm tumor in the gallbladder (""TT vatsa, epäilty 6 x 5 cm kasvain sappitiessä"") - this introduces a potential malignancy not present originally.

The treatment section shows ""dekompensoituneen alkoholihepatiitin"" changed to just ""dekompensoituneen hepatiitin,"" removing the alcohol-related specification. This could broaden the interpretation.

Finally in ""Suunnitelma,"" the referral changed from ""gastroenterologiselle poliklinikalle"" to ""onkologiselle poliklinikalle"" - shifting from GI follow-up to oncology, likely due to the added tumor suspicion.

I'm counting four distinct changes that alter medical meaning: jaundice duration, ALAT value, tumor addition, hepatitis specification change, and referral destination. Rephrasings like ""alkoholihepatiittipisteet"" to unspecified ""hepatiitin"" and minor spelling variations don't count as meaningful.

The total is 4 meaningful changes that impact clinical interpretation.

Looking at the ""Hoidon syy"" section: ""kuukauden ajan"" changed to ""neljän viikon ajan"" - both mean about a month, so no medical meaning change. 

In ""Esitiedot"": 
- ""COPD"" to ""Keuhkoahtaumatauti"" is just the Finnish translation of COPD, same meaning. 
- ""johtuen"" to ""takia"" are synonyms meaning ""due to"". 
- ""puolivälistä"" to ""puolväliä"" are equivalent time references for mid-January.

For ""Hoitojakso"":
- ""Potilaalla jatkuvaa"" vs ""Potilas kokenut jatkuvaa"" - both indicate the patient experienced pain, no meaning change.
- ""Ei kuumetta"" to ""Afebriili"" are both ""no fever"".
- ""Lääkityksen noudattaminen puutteellista"" vs ""Lääkityksen sitoutuminen huono"" both mean poor medication adherence.
- ""Antibiootti vaihdettu"" vs ""Annettu glypressiniä"" - wait, actually ""Antibiootti vaihdettu"" appears in both, but in modified version ""Annettu glypressiniä"" is correctly placed in treatment section. 
- ""Antibiootti (erytromysiini)"" adds parentheses but same drug.
- ""Annostus kefotaksiimiä pienennettiin"" vs original's ""Kefotaksiimiannos pienennettiin"" - identical meaning.

In ""Jatkosuunnitelma"": 
- ""jatkoseurantaan"" to ""jatkuvaa seurantaa ja hoitoa varten"" - both refer to follow-up care, no clinical difference.

Diagnosis sections: 
- ""Toissijaiset diagnoosit"" changes COPD to Finnish equivalent, same meaning.
- ""Päädiagnoosi"" to ""Primaaridiagnoosi"" - just terminology variation.

The only potential meaningful change I see is in medication section: original has ""Laktuloosi 670 Mg 20100+0+20100"" which appears inconsistent (likely typo), while modified keeps same. But since both have identical text, no change.

After thorough comparison, I find no alterations that change medical meaning - all are synonymous rephrasings. Therefore, meaningful changes count is zero.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case reports. I need to carefully compare the original and modified versions to identify only those changes that alter medical meaning, ignoring synonyms or rephrasings that don't change the clinical significance.

Looking at the ""Hoidon syy"" section: ""kuukauden ajan jatkuneen"" vs ""neljän viikon ajan jatkuneen"" - changing ""month"" to ""four weeks"" is just a temporal synonym since both mean approximately the same duration. No medical meaning change.

In ""Esitiedot"":

The ""Hoitojakso"" section appears identical in medical content - no changes detected in symptoms, findings, treatments or outcomes. Even the medication list and diagnoses match completely.

The only potential change I notice is in the medication list: ""Karvediloli"" vs ""Carvedilol"" in the original's narrative section. But in the structured ""Lääkityks"" list, both versions say ""Karvediloli"", so this seems like consistent spelling. No actual medication change.

After thorough comparison, I can't find any modifications that alter the clinical meaning. All changes are linguistic equivalencies in Finnish. Therefore, the count of meaningful medical changes is zero.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case versions. I need to focus only on deletions, additions, or modifications that alter medical meaning, ignoring rephrasings or synonyms that keep the same meaning.

Looking at the original and modified text:

In ""Esitiedot"" (Presenting Information), the modified version deletes ""Lämpö 39 °C"" (Temperature 39°C). This is a meaningful deletion because fever is a key clinical finding for infection.

In ""Perussairaudet"" (Underlying Conditions), ""DM2"" (Type 2 Diabetes) is removed. This is significant because diabetes affects infection management and is part of the patient's comorbidity profile.

In ""Hoitojakso"" (Treatment Course), several deletions occur: 
- Lab values ""CRP 279. Leukosyytit 16,2. P-Krea 137"" are gone. These show inflammation and kidney function, crucial for diagnosis and treatment monitoring.
- The phrase ""Ei kuumetta"" (No fever) is removed, which tracks symptom resolution.
- Follow-up labs ""CRP 147, leukosyytit normalisoituneet, P-Krea 128"" are deleted. These demonstrate treatment response and are medically important.

In ""Kotilääkitys"" (Home Medication), ""Metformin (Metformiini), 500 mg 2+0+2"" is removed. This is a key diabetes medication, and its absence changes the medication list meaningfully.

In ""Toissijaiset diagnoosit"" (Secondary Diagnoses), ""Diabetes mellitus tyyppi 2"" is deleted, which directly relates to the removed comorbidity and medication.

The ""Päädiagnoosi"" (Primary Diagnosis) remains unchanged.

I count five distinct meaningful deletions: 
1. Fever in presenting info 
2. DM2 in underlying conditions 
3. Initial lab values 
4. Follow-up lab values and ""no fever"" 
5. Metformin in home meds and DM2 in secondary diagnoses

The other changes are either structural or non-medical (like date formatting) and don't alter clinical meaning. So the total meaningful changes are 5.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case versions. The case ID is medicine_1 with a deletion variation type. I need to focus only on changes that alter medical meaning, ignoring rephrasings or synonyms.

Looking at the original text first: The patient is a 69-year-old man presenting with right leg swelling starting 3 days prior. He has comorbidities including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Key details include fever (39°C), elevated CRP and leukocytes, and penicillin treatment for suspected erysipelas. The modified version has several deletions.

Now examining the modified version: In ""Esitiedot"" (Presenting Information), the temperature reading ""Lämpö 39 °C"" is completely removed. In ""Perussairaudet"" (Comorbidities), ""DM2"" (diabetes mellitus type 2) is missing. In ""Hoitojakso"" (Treatment Course), the phrase ""Ei kuumetta"" (no fever) is deleted. In ""Kotilääkitys"" (Home Medication), Metformin is removed. These are all deletions of specific medical data.

I need to determine if these deletions are meaningful. Removing the initial fever (39°C) affects the clinical picture of infection. Deleting DM2 from comorbidities changes the patient's medical history profile. Omitting ""Ei kuumetta"" (no fever) during treatment removes important follow-up information. Eliminating Metformin from medications alters the documented treatment regimen. All these seem like medically significant deletions.

The other changes appear to be structural (like section order) or minor wording adjustments that don't change meaning. For example, ""P-Krea 128"" moving positions doesn't alter the value itself. The core diagnosis and treatment plan remain consistent.

So I identify four meaningful deletions: 1) Initial fever, 2) DM2 comorbidity, 3) Absence of fever during treatment, and 4) Metformin medication. That makes four meaningful changes that alter the medical content.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish clinical case versions where the modification type is ""delete"". 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In ""Esitiedot"", the modified version deletes ""punaisuuden ilmaantumista"" (redness appearance) and ""Lämpö 39 °C"" (fever). Both are clinically significant findings for infection.

Under ""Perussairaudet"", ""DM2"" (type 2 diabetes) is removed - a major comorbidity affecting treatment.

The ""Hoitojakso"" section has multiple deletions:
- Missing physical findings: ""selkeästi rajautunut punoitus"" (clearly demarcated redness)
- Omitted lab values: CRP 279, leukocytes 16.2, P-Crea 137 and their improvements (CRP 147, normalized leukocytes, P-Crea 128)
- Deleted fever status (""Ei kuumetta"")
- Removed antibiotic switch details (IV to oral penicillin) and treatment end date

""Kotilääkitys"" loses Metformin - crucial for diabetes management.

""Päädiagnoosi"" deletes both the diagnosis name ""Ruusu"" (erysipelas) and ICD code A46.9.

These aren't mere rephrasings - each deletion removes concrete clinical data: symptoms, lab results, comorbidities, medications, and diagnostic codes. The fever deletion alone changes the sepsis risk assessment, while removing diabetes affects antibiotic choice considerations. The 15 deletions fundamentally alter the medical narrative.

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified Finnish medical texts for Case ID medicine_1 and count only meaningful changes that alter medical meaning. First, I'll go through each section step by step.

Starting with ""Esitiedot"" (Presenting Information):
- Original: ""turvonneen oikean jalan takia"" (due to a swollen right leg)
- Modified: ""hieman turvonneen oikean jalan takia"" (due to a slightly swollen right leg)
  Adding ""hieman"" (slightly) modifies the severity. This could be meaningful as it downplays the swelling's intensity, which might affect clinical assessment.

Next, ""Hoitojakso"" (Treatment Course):
1. Physical findings:
   - Original: ""selkeästi rajautunut punoitus ja palpaatioarkuus"" (clearly demarcated redness and tenderness on palpation)
   - Modified: ""hieman rajautunut punoitus ja pieni palpaatioarkuus"" (slightly demarcated redness and slight tenderness on palpation)
   Changing ""selkeästi"" to ""hieman"" and ""pieni"" reduces the severity of symptoms. This is a meaningful change as it alters the clinical presentation's acuity.

2. Antibiotic initiation:
   - Original: Started with Bentsyylipenisilliini IV, later switched to oral Fenoksimetyylipenisilliini.
   - Modified: Directly started on oral Fenoksimetyylipenisilliini.
   Skipping IV antibiotics could be significant, especially considering initial high CRP (279) and fever. This change in treatment approach might impact the patient's management strategy.

3. Post-treatment update:
   - Original: Antibiotic switch mentioned explicitly.
   - Modified: No mention of the switch; only oral antibiotics from start.
   The removal of IV antibiotics initiation is a deletion that changes the treatment narrative.

4. Discharge planning:
   - Original: Includes antibiotic switch and continuation plan.
   - Modified: Lacks details on antibiotic change, only mentions discharge.
   Omitting the antibiotic switch details might affect understanding of treatment progression.

Other sections like ""Kotilääkitys"" (Home Meds), ""Toimenpiteet"" (Procedures), ""Suunnitelma"" (Plan), and diagnoses remain identical. Rephrasings like ""p.o."" vs. ""suun kautta"" are synonyms and not meaningful changes.

So, the meaningful changes are:
1. Swelling severity in Esitiedot.
2. Symptom severity in Hoitojakso findings.
3. Initial antibiotic route (IV vs. oral).
4. Omission of antibiotic switch details.

That totals 4 meaningful changes.

First, I'll systematically compare each section. In ""Esitiedot"", I notice three modifications: ""turvonneen"" changed to ""hieman turvonneen"" (adding mildness), removal of ""kävelyn vaikeutumista"" (walking difficulty), and temperature lowered from 39°C to 38°C. These are clinically significant as they indicate milder presentation.

Moving to ""Hoitojakso"", multiple changes stand out: 
- Examination findings now describe milder symptoms (""hieman turvonneet"", ""hieman rajautunut"", ""pieni palpaatioarkuus"")
- Initial CRP/leukocyte values are lower (279→179, 16.2→12.2)
- Antibiotic route changed from IV penicillin to oral
- Ultrasound now show deep vein thrombosis (DVT) evidence instead of being normal
- Post-treatment CRP is 47 instead of 147
- The IV-to-oral antibiotic switch detail is removed

The ""Kotilääkitys"" section adds Eliquis (apixaban) for anticoagulation, a major therapeutic addition. ""Suunnitelma"" now includes anticoagulation therapy. Most crucially, the ""Päädiagnoosi"" completely changes from erysipelas (A46.9) to femoral thrombophlebitis (I80.1), representing a fundamental diagnostic shift.

I'methodically counting each distinct medical meaning alteration:
1-3. Three symptom changes in presentation
4-5. Two lab value modifications (CRP, leukocytes)
6. Antibiotic administration route change
7. Ultrasound finding reversal (normal → DVT)
8. Post-treatment CRP change
9. Addition of anticoagulant
10. Treatment plan expansion
11. Primary diagnosis overhaul

That totals 11 meaningful changes. The chronic condition descriptions and unchanged medications don't count as they preserve original meaning.

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In **Esitiedot**:

- Removal of ""kävelyn vaikeutumista"" is a deletion of symptom
- Addition of ""hengenahdistusta"" (dyspnea) is new symptom
- Temperature changed from 39°C to 38°C (clinically significant)

- Kidney disease moved to secondary diagnoses

In **Hoitojakso**:
- Lab values completely changed (CRP 279→13, leukocytes 16.2→8.2)
- Added D-dimer and SpO2 values
- Antibiotics replaced with apixaban anticoagulation
- Ultrasound findings now positive for DVT and PE
- Treatment response now shows SpO2 improvement
- Antibiotic switch removed

In **Kotilääkitys**:
- Antibiotic replaced with apixaban
- Different duration (6 months vs antibiotic course)

In **Suunnitelma**:
- Antibiotics → anticoagulation
- Added follow-up for thrombophilia

In **Diagnoosit**:
- Primary diagnosis changed from erysipelas (A46.9) to DVT (I80.1) and PE (I26.9)
- Comorbidities redistributed

Meaningful changes I count:
1. Symptom changes (dyspnea added, walking difficulty removed)
2. Comorbidity substitution (COPD for kidney disease)
3. All lab/value alterations
4. Diagnostic/treatment shift (DVT/PE vs erysipelas)
5. Medication change (anticoagulant vs antibiotic)
6. Ultrasound findings reversal
7. Follow-up plan modification
8. Primary diagnosis overhaul
9. Oxygen saturation addition/monitoring
10. Thrombophilia suspicion added

That's 10 distinct medical meaning alterations. The temperature change alone could be borderline, but combined with other vital sign changes (SpO2) and new respiratory symptoms, it contributes to the different clinical picture.

- ""Lämpö 39 °C"" muuttui ""Kehon lämpö 39 °C"" - tämä on vain tarkennus, ei merkityksellinen muutos.

Perussairaudet-osio:
- ""Verenpainetauti"" lyheni ""HTA"":ksi - tämä on lyhennesynonyymi, yleinen lyhenne verenpainetaudista.

Hoitojakso-osio:
- ""palpaatioarkuus"" muuttui ""palpaatiokipu"" - tämä saattaa olla merkityksellinen, koska ""arkuus"" voi tarkoittaa herkkyyttä, kun taas ""kipu"" tarkoittaa kipua. Tarkistan sanat: suomessa ""arkuus"" viittaa usein kipuherkkyyteen, joten muutos ei välttämättä muuta merkitystä.
- ""Veriviljelyt otettu"" muuttui ""Veriviljelyt saatu"" - tämä on pieni kielioppimuutos, ei merkityksellinen.
- ""epäiltyn ruusun vuoksi"" pysyi samana, kirjoitusvirhe molemmissa (""epäiltyn"" pitäisi olla ""epäillyn"").
- ""ei havaittu tukokseen viittaavaa"" muuttui ""ei havaittu DVT:hen viittaavaa"" - tämä on merkityksellinen, koska ""tukos"" on yleinen termi, kun taas ""DVT"" tarkoittaa nimenomaan syvää laskimotukosta. Tämä tarkentaa diagnoosia.
- ""Bentsyylipenisilliini vaihdettu"" muuttui ""Bentsyylipenisilliini i.v. vaihdettu"" - tämä lisää tietoa antotavasta (i.v.), mutta se oli implisiittisesti tiedossa, joten se ei muuta merkitystä.

Kotilääkitys, Toimenpiteet, Suunnitelma, Diagnoosit - osiot ovat käytännössä identtiset. Suunnitelmassa ""P.o. antibioottihoito"" muuttui ""Suun kautta otettava antibioottihoito"" - tämä on synonyymi, koska ""P.o."" tarkoittaa per os (suun kautta).

Päädiagnoosi pysynyt samana.

Nyt lasken merkitykselliset muutokset:
1. DVT-muutos hoitojaksossa (tukos → DVT) - tämä on tarkentava muutos, joka muuttaa lääketieteellistä tarkkuutta.

Muita muutoksia ei ole, jotka muuttaisivat merkitystä. Kaikki muut olivat synonyymejä tai kieliopillisia hienosäätöjä.

Lopullinen määrä on 1.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case reports. I need to focus only on modifications that alter medical meaning, ignoring synonyms and rephrasings that keep the same meaning.

Looking at the ""Esitiedot"" section: ""turvonneen oikean jalan"" changed to ""turvonneen oikean alaraajan"" - both mean ""swollen right leg"" so this is just a synonym. ""Punoituksen"" to ""eryteeman"" - both mean ""redness"" (erythema), so again synonymous. ""Lämpö"" to ""Kehon lämpö"" - both mean ""temperature,"" so no change. 

In ""Perussairaudet"": ""Verenpainetauti"" to ""HTA"" - HTA is the abbreviation for hypertension, so same meaning. ""DM2"" expanded to ""diabetes mellitus tyyppi 2"" - DM2 is standard shorthand for type 2 diabetes, so equivalent. 

For ""Hoitojakso"": ""palpaatioarkuus"" to ""palpaatiokipu"" - both mean ""tenderness on palpation,"" so synonymous. ""Veriviljelyt otettu"" to ""Veriviljelyt saatu"" - ""taken"" vs ""obtained,"" same meaning. ""Syvän laskimotukoksen"" to ""DVT:n"" - DVT is the abbreviation for deep vein thrombosis, so identical. ""Tukokseen viittaavaa"" to ""DVT:hen viittaavaa"" - same concept. ""vaimoa"" to ""puolisoa"" - ""wife"" vs ""spouse,"" but in context, it's the same person. ""Bentsyylipenisilliini vaihdettu"" to ""Bentsyylipenisilliini i.v. vaihdettu"" - adding ""i.v."" clarifies but doesn't change meaning since it was already intravenous. 

In ""Suunnitelma"": ""P.o. antibioottihoito"" to ""Suun kautta otettava antibioottihoito jatkuu"" - P.o. means per os (by mouth), and ""suun kautta otettava"" means the same. Adding ""jatkuu"" (continues) is new but doesn't alter medical management. ""Seuranalle ei tarvetta"" to ""Seuranalle ei välttämätön"" - ""no need"" vs ""not necessary,"" same meaning. 

All other sections like ""Kotilääkitys,"" ""Toimenpiteet,"" and diagnoses are identical. 

I don't see any changes that affect clinical interpretation - no altered values, treatments, or diagnoses. The modifications are purely linguistic equivalences. Therefore, the count of meaningful changes is zero.

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified Finnish medical texts for Case ID medicine_1 and count meaningful changes that alter medical meaning. First, I'll go through each section methodically.

Starting with **Esitiedot**: 
- Original says ""turvonneen oikean jalan"" (swollen right leg), modified uses ""turvonneen oikean alaraajan"" (swollen right lower limb). ""Jalka"" vs. ""alaraaja"" – both refer to the leg, so this is a synonym without medical meaning change. 
- ""Punoituksen"" (redness) changed to ""eryteeman"" (erythema). Erythema is a medical term for redness, so it's more precise but doesn't alter the meaning. 
- No other changes here. 

**Perussairaudet** is identical. 

**Hoitojakso**:
- ""tukokseen viittaavaa"" (suggestive of occlusion) replaced with ""DVT:hen viittaavaa"" (suggestive of DVT). DVT is deep vein thrombosis, which is a specific type of occlusion. This clarifies but doesn't change the meaning since the context is excluding deep vein thrombosis via ultrasound. 
- The antibiotic change: Original says ""Bentsyylipenisilliini vaihdettu suun kautta..."" while modified specifies ""Bentsyylipenisilliini i.v. vaihdettu..."" Adding ""i.v."" here just clarifies the route but doesn't change the action. 

**Kotilääkitys**, **Toimenpiteet**, **Toissijaiset diagnoosit**, and **Päädiagnoosi** are identical. 

**Suunnitelma**: 
- ""P.o. antibioottihoito"" changed to ""Suun kautta otettava antibioottihoito"". Both mean oral antibiotic treatment, so synonymous. 

All changes are synonyms or clarifications that don't alter medical meaning. Therefore, no meaningful changes found.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case reports. I need to focus only on alterations that affect medical meaning, ignoring rephrasing or synonyms that don't change the clinical context.

Looking at the ""Esitiedot"" section, the modified version deleted ""Tuetussa"" from ""Tuetussa asumisyksikössa"". This changes the care setting from ""supported housing unit"" to just ""housing unit"", which could impact understanding of the patient's baseline support needs.

In ""Perussairaudet"", ""skitsofrenia"" (schizophrenia) is completely removed from the modified version. This is a significant deletion as it affects psychiatric comorbidities and medication management.

The ""Hoitojakso"" section shows two changes: removal of ""Potilas käyttää rollaattoria liikkumiseen ja on kaatunut useita kertoja viime aikoina"" (patient uses walker and has fallen multiple times) and ""Olantsapiini"" (olanzapine) is missing from medications. The mobility and fall risk deletion impacts safety assessments, while the antipsychotic removal affects treatment continuity.

In ""Lääkitys"" (medications), the omission of olanzapine confirms its deletion. The ""Toissijaiset diagnoosit"" section also lacks schizophrenia, consistent with earlier deletion.

All other changes appear to be minor rephrasing (""hoitohenkilökunta"" to passive voice) or identical content. The core pneumonia treatment, observations, and plans remain unchanged.

I count four distinct medical meaning alterations: 1) care setting downgrade, 2) schizophrenia comorbidity removal, 3) mobility/fall risk deletion, 4) antipsychotic medication omission. Each affects clinical decision-making independently.

The response should receive the number 4.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case versions. I need to focus only on alterations that affect medical meaning, ignoring rephrasing or synonyms that don't change the core information.

Looking at the ""Esitiedot"" section, the modified version deletes ""Tuetussa"" from ""Tuetussa asumisyksikössä"" - this removes information about the patient's supported living situation, which could impact care context.

In ""Perussairaudet,"" schizophrenia (""skitsofrenia"") is completely removed from the modified version. This is a significant deletion as it affects psychiatric management and medication decisions.

The ""Hoitojakso"" section has multiple changes: 
- Deletion of ""CRP 143"" in initial findings removes a key inflammation marker. 
- Removal of ""ja mahdollisen bakteeri-infektion vuoksi"" from antibiotic rationale omits the suspected bacterial co-infection. 
- Deleting ""Potilas kokee vointinsa paremmaksi antibiootti hoidon aloittamisen jälkeen"" eliminates documentation of treatment response. 
- Omitting ""CRP alkuun nousussa, nyt 199"" removes crucial infection progression data. 
- The fall history (""kaatunut useita kertoja viime aikoina"" and rollator use are deleted, affecting mobility assessment.

In ""Lääkitys,"" olanzapine (""Olantsapiini 10 mg"") is removed - this directly relates to the deleted schizophrenia diagnosis and affects medication reconciliation.

For diagnoses: 
- Secondary diagnoses lose schizophrenia 
- Primary diagnoses remove ""J15.9 Määrittämätön bakteerin aiheuttama keuhkokuume"" - this fundamentally changes the diagnostic picture by eliminating bacterial pneumonia.

I count 8 distinct meaningful changes: 
1) Supported living context removal 
2) Schizophrenia comorbidity deletion 
3) Initial CRP value omission 
4) Bacterial infection suspicion removal 
5) Antibiotic response documentation deletion 
6) Follow-up CRP trend removal 
7) Mobility issues and fall history deletion 
8) Antipsychotic medication removal 
Plus two major diagnostic deletions (schizophrenia and bacterial pneumonia) making 10 total meaningful changes that alter clinical interpretation.

Looking at the ""Esitiedot"" section, the modified version deletes ""Tuetussa"" from ""Tuetussa asumisyksikössä"" - this removes the detail about supported housing, which seems medically relevant for context.

In ""Perussairaudet"", ""skitsofrenia"" is completely removed from the comorbidities. That's a significant deletion affecting the patient's medical history.

The ""Hoitojakso"" section has multiple changes: 
- Removal of PCR positivity for influenza A diagnosis
- Omission of CRP value 143 and its later increase to 199
- Deletion of antibiotic initiation details (oseltamiviiri and kefotaksiimi)
- Removal of patient feeling better after antibiotics
- Missing information about medication switch from kefotaksiimi to doksisykliini
- No mention of rollator use or recent falls

In ""Lääkitys"", olanzapine (olantsapiini) is removed from medications - directly related to the schizophrenia deletion.

For ""Toissijaiset diagnoosit"" and ""Päädiagnoosi"", schizophrenia is missing from secondary diagnoses, and primary diagnoses are completely blank in the modified version.

The ""Erotusdiagnoosit"" appears identical in both versions.

I'm counting 8 distinct meaningful deletions:

3) Influenza PCR confirmation 
4) Initial CRP value 
5) Antibiotic initiation rationale 
6) Patient improvement note

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between two Finnish clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

**Esitiedot (Background):**
- Age changed from 79 to 29 (significant)
- Found location: from ""lattialta"" (floor) in care facility to ""ulkopuolelta"" (outside) by relatives (significant)
- Discovery: hoitohenkilökunta → omaiset (change in who found patient)

**Perussairaudet (Comorbidities):**
- COPD + BPH → Astma + tupakoi (smoker) - major change
- Skitsofrenia remains

**Hoitojakso (Treatment course):**
- Symptoms: added ""sekava, hallusinoi"" (confused, hallucinating) and difficulty examining
- Vital signs: Temp 38.7→36.7, Sat 85%→95%, CRP 143→3 - all clinically significant
- Imaging: Thorax-TT findings completely removed in modified version
- Treatment: Kefotaksiimi removed, no mention of oxygen therapy
- Microbiology: Moraxella → Klamydia (different pathogen)
- Mental status: New delusional hotel narrative and medication non-compliance
- Transfer: Geriatric → Psychiatric ward

**Lääkitys (Medications):**
- Finasteridi and Doksisykliini removed
- Modified version lacks antibiotic switch documentation

**Diagnoses:**
- Entirely rewritten: Influenza/pneumonia diagnoses replaced with schizophrenia-related
- Comorbidities simplified to only asthma/schizophrenia

**Suunnitelma (Plan):**
- Follow-up changed from pulmonary nodule monitoring to psychiatric care

Counting meaningful changes:
1. Age + comorbidities
2. Presentation circumstances 
3. Vital signs/CRP
4. Removed thoracic findings 
5. Different pathogen 
6. New psychiatric symptoms 
7. Medication non-compliance 
8. Changed transfer unit 
9. Altered medication list 
10. Completely different diagnoses 
11. Changed follow-up plan

That's 11 distinct medical meaning alterations. The core has shifted from respiratory infection management to acute psychiatric care with incidental findings.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case versions. I need to focus only on alterations that affect medical meaning, ignoring rephrasing or synonyms that don't change anything.

Looking at the ""Esitiedot"" section: The modified version changes who found the patient and where - from staff finding him on the floor in supported housing to relatives finding him outside the unit. This is a meaningful change in circumstances.

In ""Hoitojakso"": Several key differences stand out. The modified version adds confusion and hallucinations, making clinical examination difficult. Temperature is now 36.7°C instead of 38.7°C, and initial CRP is 3 instead of 143. The pathogen in culture changed from Moraxella to Chlamydia. There's a new detail about staff finding hidden medications, suggesting non-adherence. The pneumonia diagnosis specifically attributes to Chlamydia now.

The ""Suunnitelma"" section adds explicit continuation of olanzapine treatment. Other sections like medications remain identical, and some diagnoses are updated to reflect the Chlamydia finding.

I'm counting each distinct medical alteration: who found patient, mental status, temperature, CRP, pathogen identification, medication non-adherence evidence, diagnosis specificity, and treatment continuation instruction. That's 8 meaningful changes. Formatting differences and unchanged sections don't count.

The user seems to need precise change detection - probably for medical record auditing or research. Strictly following their counting rules is crucial here.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case reports. I need to focus only on changes that alter medical meaning, ignoring rephrasings or synonyms that keep the same meaning.

Looking at the ""Esitiedot"" section: The original says hoitohenkilökunta found the patient on the floor in a supported living unit. The modified version says omaiset (relatives) found the patient outside the supported living unit when coming to visit. This changes who found the patient and the location, which could be medically relevant for understanding the patient's condition and circumstances.

In the ""Hoitojakso"" section: Several vital signs are different - lämpö (temperature) is 38.7°C in original vs 36.7°C in modified, CRP is 143 vs 43. These are significant clinical value changes. Also, the infection finding changes from ""Nielunäytteessä kasvu Moraxella"" to ""Viljelyssä Klamydia löydöksenä"" - that's a completely different pathogen identification.

The ""Toissijaiset diagnoosit"" section shows a change from ""Määrittämätön bakteerin aiheuttama keuhkokuume"" to ""Klamydian aiheuttama keuhkokuume"" - this is a specific diagnosis change based on the new lab finding.

I notice the ""Päädiagnoosi"" still lists J15.9 (unspecified bacterial pneumonia) in both versions despite the secondary diagnosis change - this might be an inconsistency in the modified version, but since the user asked to count changes, I'll focus on what's explicitly different.

Other sections like lääkitys, suunnitelma, toimenpiteet, and erotusdiagnoosit appear identical. The location change in esitiedot, the vital signs in hoitojakso, and the pathogen/diagnosis changes are the meaningful medical differences.

Counting them: 1) Discovery circumstances change, 2) Initial CRP value, 3) Initial temperature, 4) Pathogen identification (Moraxella to Chlamydia), 5) Secondary diagnosis specification. That's five meaningful changes. The later CRP of 199 appears in both, so not a change. I'll go with 5.

Looking at the ""Esitiedot"" section: ""epäiltyn influenssan"" changed to ""todennäköisen influenssan"" - this shifts from ""suspected"" to ""probable"" influenza, which is medically significant. Also ""hoitohenkilökunta löytäneet"" to ""henkilöstö havainneet"" is just synonym replacement (staff found vs staff observed), so no meaning change.

In ""Perussairaudet"": ""COPD"" to ""keuhkoahtaumatauti"" is the Finnish equivalent term, so no actual change. Both mean chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The ""Hoitojakso"" section has several changes: ""valittaa"" to ""kertoo"" (complains vs reports) is a nuance but doesn't alter the symptom reporting. ""Ei poikkeavaa"" to ""Ei löydöksiä"" both mean no abnormalities found. ""nodulaarimuutos"" to ""nodulaari leesio"" - lesion instead of change could be medically different, as lesion implies pathology while change is more neutral. ""suosituksesta"" to ""kehotuksesta"" (recommendation vs urging) is just wording.

""Jatkosuunnitelma"" section adds ""keuhkokuvaa varten"" (for chest X-ray) which specifies the imaging modality - this is a meaningful addition. ""Toimenpiteet"" changes from ""Ei toimenpiteitä"" to ""Ei tehty toimenpiteitä"" - same meaning (no procedures done).

Diagnosis sections show ""toissijaiset"" to ""sekundääriset"" (secondary) and ""päädiagnoosi"" to ""primaarinen diagnoosi"" (primary) - these are synonymous in medical context. ""Erotusdiagnoosit"" remains identical.

The medically significant changes are: 1) suspected→probable influenza in presentation, 2) nodular change→lesion in imaging finding, and 3) added specification for chest X-ray in follow-up plan. That's three meaningful changes.

I'll respond with just the number 3 as requested.

Looking at the ""Esitiedot"" section: ""epäiltyn influenssan"" changed to ""todennäköisen influenssan"" - this shifts from ""suspected"" to ""probable"" influenza, which could affect diagnostic interpretation. Then ""hoitohenkilökunta löytäneet"" became ""henkilöstö havainneet"" - this is just synonym substitution (staff noticed vs found) without medical meaning.

In ""Perussairaudet"": ""COPD"" changed to ""keuhkoahtaumatauti"" - this is the Finnish translation of COPD, so no meaning change. 

The ""Hoitojakso"" section has several changes: ""valittaa"" to ""kertoo"" (complains vs reports) is stylistic. ""Ei poikkeavaa"" to ""Ei löydöksiä"" (no abnormalities vs no findings) is equivalent. ""nodulaarimuutos"" to ""nodulaari leesio"" - both mean nodular lesion, so synonymous. ""Hengenahdistusta vain rasituksessa"" to ""Ainoastaan rasituksessa hengenahdistusta"" is just word order change. ""suosituksesta"" to ""kehotuksesta"" (recommendation vs urging) might imply different urgency, but in clinical context both suggest transfer advice.

The medication, plan, procedures, and diagnoses sections appear identical. 

The meaningful change is only in the admission reason from ""suspected"" to ""probable"" influenza. That's one meaningful change. All other alterations are linguistic variations without clinical impact. 

I'll count just this single meaningful change that affects medical interpretation.

First, I'll systematically compare each section. In ""Esitiedot"", ""epäiltyn"" becomes ""todennäköisen"" - both indicate suspicion of influenza, so no meaning change. ""Hoitohenkilökunta löytäneet"" changes to ""henkilöstö havainneet"" - different terms for staff finding patient, but same action. 

Moving to ""Perussairaudet"", ""COPD"" is replaced with ""keuhkoahtaumatauti"" - this is just the Finnish translation of COPD acronym, so medically equivalent. 

The entire ""Hoitojakso"" section appears identical except for the COPD synonym already noted. Medication lists, plans, procedures and diagnoses sections show no changes at all. 

The ""Erotusdiagnoosit"" section has ""Pitkäaikainen ahtauttava keuhkosairaus"" which corresponds to the earlier COPD description - again synonymous. 

After thorough comparison, I confirm all changes are either synonymous terms (""COPD"" vs ""keuhkoahtaumatauti"") or equivalent phrasing (""hoitohenkilökunta"" vs ""henkilöstö""). No alterations affect medical meaning - the patient's condition, treatment, and outcomes remain unchanged.

Looking at the ""Hoidon syy"" section: The modified version deletes ""ja oksentelua"" from the symptoms. Vomiting is a clinically significant symptom, so this deletion changes the presentation.

In ""Perusssairaudet"": The modified version removes ""Lapsena umpilisäke poistettu"" (childhood appendectomy) and ""Biopsiassa todettiin krooninen ileiitti silloin"" (chronic ileitis diagnosis). Both are relevant medical facts - the appendectomy could relate to abdominal issues, and the ileitis directly explains current symptoms.

In ""Hoitojakso"": The modified version deletes ""pahoinvoinnin ja oksentelun takia"" from the eating difficulty description. Again, removing vomiting reference alters symptom documentation. It also omits ""voimakasta"" when describing abdominal pain, which reduces severity - a meaningful change.

Other sections like medications, plan, and diagnoses appear identical. The deletions I spotted all impact clinical understanding: omitting past surgeries, chronic conditions, and key symptoms like vomiting and pain severity. That's 4 distinct meaningful deletions.

I'll count each deletion that changes medical meaning: 1) vomiting in symptoms, 2) appendectomy history, 3) chronic ileitis diagnosis, 4) vomiting in eating difficulty, and 5) pain severity descriptor. That makes 5 meaningful changes.

Looking at the ""Hoidon syy"" section, the modified version deletes ""Lisäksi neljän päivän ajan ollut ummetusta ja oksentelua"" - that's a meaningful removal of constipation and vomiting symptoms.

In ""Perusssairaudet"", they removed ""Lapsena umpilisäke poistettu"" (childhood appendectomy) and shortened ""vatsakipujen vuoksi. Biopsiassa todettiin krooninen ileiitti silloin"" to just ""tammikuussa"" - deleting both the appendectomy history and the biopsy-confirmed chronic ileitis diagnosis. That's two significant deletions.

For ""Hoitojakso"", they removed ""voimakasta"" from the pain description, deleted the TT-kuva finding about terminal ileum ileitis, and removed ""pahoinvoinnin ja oksentelun takia"" from the eating difficulty description. They also omitted ""terminaali-ileumin ileiittimuutosten vuoksi"" from the admission reason. That's four meaningful deletions.

The ""Lääkitys"", ""Suunnitelma"", ""Toimenpiteet"", and diagnosis sections appear identical. No changes there.

Looking at the ""Hoidon syy"" section, the modified version deletes ""Lisäksi neljän päivän ajan ollut ummetusta ja oksentelua"" (constipation and vomiting for four days). This removes important symptoms, so it's a meaningful deletion.

In ""Perusssairaudet,"" the modified version deletes ""Lapsena umpilisäke poistettu"" (appendix removed as a child) and shortens ""vatsakipujen vuoksi. Biopsiassa todettiin krooninen ileiitti silloin"" to just ""tammikuussa."" This removes surgical history and biopsy-confirmed chronic ileitis, which are clinically significant.

For ""Hoitojakso,"" several deletions occur: ""voimakasta"" (severe) describing pain, ""CRP 49"" (inflammatory marker value), ""Vatsan TT-kuvassa viitteitä ileiitistä terminaali-ileumissa"" (imaging evidence of ileitis), and the specific admission reason ""terminaali-ileumin ileiittimuutosten vuoksi."" Also deleted are ""pahoinvoinnin ja oksentelun takia"" (due to nausea/vomiting) and ""Löydöksenä duodenaopatia"" (duodenopathy finding). The CRP improvement to 29 is also missing. These all alter medical understanding.

In ""Toissijaiset diagnoosit,"" ""Ummetus"" (constipation) is removed, and ""Erotusdiagnoosit"" deletes two differential diagnoses (Gastroenteriitti, Keliakia) while misspelling ""Crohnin"" as ""Chronin."" The misspelling doesn't change meaning, but removing diagnoses does.

The medication list remains identical, so no changes there. Other sections like ""Suunnitelma"" and ""Toimenpiteet"" are unchanged.

I count 9 meaningful deletions: 1 in Hoidon syy, 3 in Perussairaudet, 4 in Hoitojakso, and 1 in Toissijaiset diagnoosit. The differential diagnosis removal counts as one change despite involving two items, as it's a single category modification. The CRP value deletion and its later mention of decrease are counted as one meaningful change since they're related data points.

- ""Biopsiassa todettiin krooninen ileiitti"" became ""Biopsiassa ei löydöksiä"" - switching from chronic ileitis to no findings is medically important.

In ""Hoitojakso"": 
- Lab values changed: LPK from 8.9 to 18.9, CRP from 49 to 149, plus added fever 38.5°C - these indicate worse inflammation. 
- Imaging changed from ""viitteitä ileiitistä"" to ""appendisiittiin viittaavia"" - shifting from ileitis to appendicitis evidence. 
- Admission reason modified from ""terminaali-ileumin ileiittimuutosten"" to ""vatsakipujen takia"" with added ""konservatiivinen hoitolinjaus"" - different clinical approach. 
- Gastroskopia result changed from ""duodenaopatia"" to ""Negatiivinen"" - significant finding alteration.

The ""Päädiagnoosi"" completely changed from ""R104X Vatsakipu"" (abdominal pain) to ""K35 Akuutti umpilisäkkeen tulehdus"" (acute appendicitis) - that's a major diagnostic shift.

First, in the ""Perusssairaudet"" section, the original mentions ""Lapsena umpilisäke poistettu"" (appendix removed as child) while modified says ""Lapsena vatsakipuoireilua"" (abdominal pain symptoms as child). That's a significant change in surgical history. The biopsy result also changed from confirmed chronic ileitis to no findings.

Looking at ""Hoitojakso"", the modified version shows much worse inflammation markers: LPK jumps from 8.9 to 22.9, CRP from 49 to 249, plus new fever of 40.5°C. The imaging findings completely change from ileitis to appendicitis. Treatment path diverges too - now there's appendectomy and antibiotics added.

The diagnosis section flips completely: original has R104X abdominal pain as primary, while modified specifies K35 acute appendicitis. Medication list adds Kefuroximi antibiotics in the modified version.

Other changes seem consistent with this new direction: admission reason now mentions appendectomy preparation, and the post-op care mentions antibiotic treatment initiation. The gastroskopia being negative also aligns with appendicitis rather than Crohn's.

I'll count each distinct medical alteration: surgical history (1), biopsy result (2), lab values (3 markers = 3 changes), fever addition (4), imaging findings (5), procedure added (appendectomy+blood cultures=6), antibiotic treatment (7), diagnosis change (8), and gastroskopia result (9). That makes 9 meaningful changes.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Hoidon syy"" and ""Lääkitys"" sections appear identical - no changes there. In ""Perussairaudet"", the original mentions ""umpilisäke poistettu"" (appendix removed) and ""krooninen ileiitti"" (chronic ileitis) in biopsy, while modified version says ""vatsakipuoireilua"" (abdominal pain symptoms) and ""ei löydöksiä"" (no findings). That's two clear medical changes: surgical history removed and biopsy result negated.

Moving to ""Hoitojakso"": 
- Original describes TT-kuvassa ""viitteitä ileiitistä"" (signs of ileitis) while modified states ""ei löydöksiä"" (no findings) - that's change #3. 
- Admission reason changes from ""termimaali-ileumin ileiittimuutosten vuoksi"" (due to ileitis) to ""vatsakipujen ja ummetuksen takia"" (due to pain/constipation) - change #4. 
- Gastroskopia results change from ""duodenaopatia"" finding to ""negatiivinen"" - change #5. 

Other sections (""Suunnitelma"", ""Toimenpiteet"", diagnoses) show no differences. The medication list is identical. 

I notice ""Perusssairaudet"" has a typo in both versions but that's irrelevant. The CRP improvement is identically reported. 

So total meaningful changes: the five alterations affecting medical interpretation (surgical history, biopsy results, imaging findings, admission rationale, and endoscopy outcome). Rephrasings like ""ei ole täysin toipunut"" vs original are stylistic.

Alright, let's tackle this medical text comparison. The task is to count meaningful changes between the original and modified Finnish clinical case, ignoring synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll scan both versions section by section. In ""Hoidon syy"", ""perusteella"" becomes ""takia"" - both mean ""due to"", so no medical impact. ""46-vuotias"" vs ""46 vuotta vanha"" is just age phrasing. 

Under ""Hoitojakso"", the key change is ""Potilaalla voimakasta vatsakipua"" (patient has severe abdominal pain) becoming ""Potilas kertoo voimakkaasta vatsakivusta"" (patient reports...). This adds subjective reporting nuance but doesn't change the pain's existence. 

Then ""viitteitä"" (indications) changes to ""indikaatiota"" (indication) in the CT finding - synonymous in medical context. 

All other sections (meds, diagnoses, plan) are identical. The added ""kertoo"" slightly shifts perspective but maintains the core clinical fact of severe pain. No deletions or data alterations found. 

Final count: Zero meaningful changes. The answer should be 0.

Hmm, the user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish medical case versions. I need just a number - no explanations. 

First, I'll scan both texts section by section. The ""Hoidon syy"" section has ""perusteella"" changed to ""takia"" - that's just a synonym for ""based on,"" so not meaningful. 

In ""Hoitojakso,"" ""Potilaalla voimakasta vatsakipua"" becomes ""Potilas kertoo voimakkaasta vatsakivusta."" That's significant! Original states abdominal pain as a fact, while modified says patient reported it. That could affect clinical interpretation. 

Later, ""palpoiden kipua"" changes to ""tutkien palpaatiokipua"" - still means pain on palpation, so no medical impact. ""Viitteitä ileiitistä"" to ""indikaatiota... ileiitistä"" is synonymous for ""indications of ileitis."" 

""Osastolle"" becoming ""vuodepaikalle"" is just ""ward"" vs ""bed,"" no real change. ""Pahoinvoinnin takia"" to ""vuoksi"" - same causal conjunction. 

""Kliininen paraneminen"" replaces ""Potilaan vointi parani"" - both mean clinical improvement, so neutral. 

In diagnoses, ""Päädiagnoosi"" vs ""Primaaridiagnoosi"" is just term variation. ""Crohnin tauti"" to ""morbus Crohn"" is the standard term change - same disease. 

All other sections (meds, plan, procedures) are identical. 

Only one change alters meaning: how the abdominal pain is presented (observed vs reported). So the count is 1.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Finnish clinical case versions, ignoring synonymous rephrasings. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Hoidon syy"" section shows ""perusteella"" changed to ""takia"" - this is a synonym for ""due to"", so no meaning change. 

In ""Hoitojakso"", several changes catch my attention:
- ""Potilaalla voimakasta vatsakipua"" becomes ""Potilas kertoo voimakkaasta vatsakivusta"" - adding ""kertoo"" (reports) implies subjective reporting rather than objective observation, which could be medically significant.
- ""palpoiden kipua"" to ""tutkien palpaatiokipua"" - ""palpoiden"" and ""palpaatiokipua"" both describe palpation pain, so synonymous.
- ""viitteitä ileiitistä"" vs ""indikaatiota ileiitistä"" - both mean ""indications of ileitis"", no change.
- ""osastolle"" to ""vuodepaikalle"" - ""ward"" vs ""bed"" might imply different care levels, but in context likely refers to same admission.
- ""pahoinvoinnin ja oksentelun takia"" replaces ""pahoinvoinnin ja oksentelun takia"" - identical phrasing.
- ""vointi parani"" to ""kliininen paraneminen"" - ""condition improved"" vs ""clinical improvement"" are medically equivalent.
- The CRP value change description remains identical.

Other sections (lääkitys, suunnitelma etc.) show no modifications. Crucially, diagnoses and medications are unchanged.

The only potentially meaningful change is the addition of ""kertoo"" (reports) regarding abdominal pain, as it introduces the patient's subjective perspective. All other alterations are synonymous rephrasing without clinical impact. Therefore, the count is 1.

Alright, let's tackle this. The task is to count meaningful changes between the original and modified medical case. I need to focus on additions, deletions, or modifications that alter the medical meaning, ignoring rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

First, I'll go through each section systematically. Starting with ""Sökorsak"" (Reason for Admission). Both versions mention a 69-year-old man admitted for shortness of breath after a trip to Spain. No changes here. 

Next, ""Tidigare sjukdomar"" (Previous Illnesses). The original lists Parkinson's disease, hypertension, and bilateral DVT. The modified version removes Parkinson's disease. That's a deletion of a pre-existing condition, which is a meaningful change because it affects the patient's medical history and could impact diagnosis and treatment decisions. So, that's one change.

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"" (Care Process). The original notes in the neurological exam: ""bradykinesi, stelhet som vid Parkinsons sjukdom och positiv Babinskis tecken bilateralt."" The modified version removes ""stelhet som vid Parkinsons sjukdom"" (stiffness as in Parkinson's disease). This deletion removes a specific symptom linked to Parkinson's, which is significant because it alters the neurological findings. The rest of the section, like the HIV diagnosis, anemia, and tests, remains the same. So, that's another meaningful change. 

In the ""Läkemedel"" (Medications) section, the original includes Madopark (Benserazid/Levodopa) for Parkinson's. The modified version omits this medication. Removing a medication for Parkinson's is a meaningful change, especially since Parkinson's was also removed from previous illnesses. That's the third change.

The ""Diagnos"" (Diagnoses) section in the original lists Parkinson's, hypertension, and DVT. The modified version excludes Parkinson's. This deletion is consistent with the earlier removal but counts as another change because it's a separate section. However, since the removal of Parkinson's is already counted in previous sections, I need to check if this is a distinct change. The diagnoses section is a separate part of the record, so removing Parkinson's here is part of the same overall deletion. But each section's alteration is a separate change. Wait, the task is to count each meaningful change. Removing Parkinson's from diagnoses is a separate deletion in a different section. So that would be the fourth change? But let me double-check.

Wait, the removal of Parkinson's is reflected in three places: previous illnesses, medications, and diagnoses. Each of these is a separate deletion in different sections. So that would be three changes. However, the task is to count each instance where the medical meaning is altered. Removing Parkinson's from the history, its medication, and the diagnosis list are three distinct changes because they affect different aspects of the record. 

Additionally, in the ""Vårdförlopp"" section, the neurological exam originally noted stiffness consistent with Parkinson's, which was removed. That's another change. So total changes: 

1. Deletion of Parkinson's from previous illnesses.
2. Deletion of Parkinson's medication (Madopark).
3. Deletion of Parkinson's from the diagnoses list.
4. Removal of ""stelhet som vid Parkinsons sjukdom"" in the care process.

That's four changes. But let me make sure there are others. 

Looking at the ""Huvuddiagnos"" (Main Diagnosis), both versions list HIV and hemolytic anemia. No changes there. 

Also, in the care process, the original had ""In tecken"" which was corrected to ""Inga tecken"" in the modified. But that's a typo fix (""In"" to ""Inga""), which doesn't change the medical meaning. So ignore that. 

Another point: the modified version in the care process says ""bradykinesi och positiv Babinskis tecken"" without mentioning stiffness. The original included stiffness as part of Parkinson's. So that specific symptom removal is a meaningful change. 

So, in total, the deletions related to Parkinson's are in three sections (previous illnesses, medications, diagnoses) and the removal of the stiffness in the neurological exam. That's four meaningful changes.

Alright, let's tackle this. I need to compare the original and modified Swedish clinical case and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. First, I'll go through each section step by step.

Starting with ""Sökorsak"" (Reason for Admission): Both versions are identical. No changes here.

Next, ""Tidigare sjukdomar"" (Previous Illnesses): The original lists Parkinson's, hypertension, and bilateral DVT. The modified version removes Parkinson's disease. That's a deletion of a pre-existing condition, which is a meaningful change.

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"" (Care Process): 
- Original mentions MetHb 5.6, Hb 96, no infection signs, leading to hypoxia and anemia of unknown cause. Modified has the same except ""In tecken"" corrected to ""Inga tecken"" – that's a typo fix, not a medical change. 
- The Hb drop from 96 to 83 is in both. 
- Original states the patient had unprotected sex, fever, rash, weight loss, tested HIV positive, started on Truvada and Tivicay. Modified removes the HIV test result and the specific drug names (Truvada and Tivicay), just saying ""treatment started."" Deleting the HIV diagnosis and specific meds is a significant change. 
- Neurological findings: Original notes bradykinesia, rigidity (as in Parkinson's), bilateral Babinski, fasciculations. Modified removes ""stelhet som vid Parkinsons sjukdom"" (rigidity as in Parkinson's). Since Parkinson's was removed earlier, this reference is consistent, but deleting the rigidity detail might be a change. However, since Parkinson's is already removed, this might be part of that deletion. 
- The rest of the investigations (MR, EMG, LP) are the same. The original's question about neurological symptoms explained by HIV is missing in the modified version. That's a meaningful change as it removes a diagnostic consideration. 
- Both end with saturation at 94% and discharge.

In ""Läkemedel"" (Medications): 
- Original has Omeprazol, Eliquis, Betolvex, Madopark (for Parkinson's), Requip, Mirtazapin, Tivicay, Truvada. 
- Modified removes Madopark (Parkinson's med), Tivicay, and Truvada (HIV meds). This directly relates to the deletion of Parkinson's and HIV, so it's a meaningful change.

""Planering"" (Planning) is identical in both.

""Diagnos"" (Diagnoses): 
- Original lists Parkinson's, hypertension, DVT. 
- Modified changes to Diabetes and DVT. Wait, diabetes wasn't mentioned before. Adding diabetes and removing Parkinson's and hypertension? That's a major change. Hypertension was in the original's previous illnesses but removed in the modified's diagnoses. Also, adding diabetes without prior mention is a significant addition.

""Huvuddiagnos"" (Main Diagnosis): 
- Original has B23.8 (HIV) and D59.9 (hemolytic anemia). 
- Modified only has D59.9, removing HIV. Meaningful deletion.

Now, tallying meaningful changes:
1. Deletion of Parkinson's in previous illnesses.
2. Deletion of HIV test result and specific HIV meds in care process.
3. Removal of the question linking neuro symptoms to HIV.
4. Removal of Madopark, Tivicay, Truvada from meds.
5. Diagnoses changed: Parkinson's and hypertension removed, diabetes added (which is new), DVT retained.
6. Main diagnosis: HIV removed, only hemolytic anemia kept.

Each of these alters medical meaning. The addition of diabetes in diagnoses without prior context is a clear addition. The other removals are deletions. So total meaningful changes: 6.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case reports for Case ID medicine_5, where the variation type is deletion. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. Starting with ""Sökorsak"" - both versions are identical, so no changes there. 

Moving to ""Tidigare sjukdomar"": The original lists Parkinson's disease, hypertension and bilateral DVT. The modified version deletes Parkinson's disease - that's one meaningful deletion. 

In ""Vårdförlopp"": Multiple deletions stand out. The modified version removes:
- Reference to no pericardial fluid in DT
- The entire HIV diagnosis sequence (unprotected sex, HIV testing positive, Truvada/Tivicay treatment)
- The hemolytic anemia discussion with hematologist
- Stiffness related to Parkinson's
- Neurological symptoms possibly explained by HIV

Each of these represents a meaningful medical information loss. The ""inga tecken"" correction from ""in"" seems like a typo fix, not meaningful. 

For ""Läkemedel"": The modified version deletes Madopark (Parkinson's medication), Tivicay and Truvada (HIV drugs) - three meaningful deletions. 

In ""Planering"": The removal of infectious disease follow-up is another meaningful change. 

Finally in ""Diagnos"": 
- Original has Parkinson's, hypertension, DVT
- Modified has diabetes and DVT - so Parkinson's and hypertension removed, diabetes added. That's three changes (two deletions, one addition). 

The ""Huvuddiagnos"" section is completely deleted in modified version - removing both HIV and hemolytic anemia diagnoses. 

Tallying these: 
- Tidigare sjukdomar: 1 deletion (Parkinson's)
- Vårdförlopp: 5 deletions (pericardial ref, HIV sequence, hemolytic anemia, Parkinson stiffness, HIV neuro link)
- Läkemedel: 3 deletions (Madopark, HIV drugs)
- Planering: 1 deletion (infectious clinic)
- Diagnos: 3 changes (Parkinson's/hypertension removed, diabetes added)
- Huvuddiagnos: 2 deletions (both diagnoses)

That totals 1+5+3+1+3+2=15 meaningful changes. I'll double-check: 
- Parkinson's removed in 3 places (history, meds, diagnosis) 
- HIV-related removals in history (unprotected sex), diagnosis (positive test), treatment (drugs), follow-up (clinic), and final diagnosis 
- Added diabetes in diagnosis 
- Removed hypertension in diagnosis 
- Removed hemolytic anemia discussion and diagnosis 
- Removed neurological details 

Yes, 15 distinct medical meaning alterations. The user emphasized counting only substantive changes, not phrasing tweaks like ""inga"" vs ""in"".

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified clinical cases in Swedish and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll ignore rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

First, looking at the ""Tidigare sjukdomar"" section. The original lists Parkinson's, hypertension, and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in Spain four months ago. The modified version changes DVT to ""hjärnslag"" (stroke) and adds diabetes mellitus typ 2. So, DVT to stroke is a significant change, and adding diabetes is a new condition. That's two changes here.

Next, in ""Vårdförlopp"". The patient had unprotected sex and fever with rash in the original. The modified version adds drug use, injections, and no hepatitis vaccines. It also changes the HIV test result from just HIV to HIV and hepatitis B. Later, the neurological symptoms' possible cause shifts from HIV-infection to sepsis. Also, the discharge saturation is the same, but the cause explanation change is meaningful. So, additions: drug use, injections, no vaccines, hepatitis B diagnosis. The change from HIV to sepsis as a cause for neurological symptoms is another. That's about four or five changes here.

In ""Läkemedel"", the modified version adds Entecavir (Baraclude) for hepatitis B. That's one addition.

""Planering"" now includes ""koagulations-"" along with infections and neuro follow-ups. Adding coagulation clinic is a new element, so one change.

""Diagnos"" section: The original lists Parkinson's, hypertension, DVT. Modified adds sepsis and keeps the others. Adding sepsis is a new diagnosis. Also, the ""Huvuddiagnos"" adds acute hepatitis B (B16). That's two additions here.

Now, tallying all: 
- Tidigare sjukdomar: 2 changes (DVT→stroke, add diabetes)
- Vårdförlopp: 5 changes (add drug use, injections, no vaccines, add hep B, change neuro cause to sepsis)
- Läkemedel: 1 (add Entecavir)
- Planering: 1 (add coagulation follow-up)
- Diagnos: 2 (add sepsis, add hep B in huvuddiagnos)

Total: 11 meaningful changes. But wait, some might be grouped. For example, adding hepatitis B in both vårdförlopp and huvuddiagnos are separate? Also, the change in neurological cause from HIV to sepsis is one change. Let me recount.

Breaking down Vårdförlopp: 
1. Added drug use and injections. 
2. Added no hepatitis vaccines. 
3. Added hepatitis B diagnosis. 
4. Changed neurological explanation from HIV to sepsis. 
That's four. 

Then Tidigare sjukdomar: two changes (DVT to stroke, add diabetes). 

Läkemedel: one addition. 

Planering: one addition. 

Diagnos: sepsis added in the list, and hepatit B in huvuddiagnos. But the huvuddiagnos already includes hepatit B as a new code. So that's two there. 

Total: 4 (vårdförlopp) + 2 (tidigare) + 1 (läkemedel) + 1 (planering) + 2 (diagnos) = 10. 

Also, in huvuddiagnos, the original had two codes, modified has three (adding B16). So that's an addition. 

But in the Diagnos section under ""Diagnos"", it lists sepsis as a new entry, and the huvuddiagnos adds hepatit B. So two separate additions. 

Yes, total 10 meaningful changes.

Alright, let's tackle this medical case evaluation. The task is to count meaningful changes between the original and modified Swedish clinical case, ignoring rephrasings or synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

**Sökorsak (Reason for Admission)**: Both versions start identically with the 69-year-old man presenting with dyspnea after a trip to Spain. No changes here.

**Tidigare sjukdomar (Past Medical History)**:
- Original: Parkinson's, hypertension, bilateral DVT in Spain 4 months ago.
- Modified: Adds ""Diabetes mellitus typ 2"" and removes hypertension? Wait no—hypertension is still listed later in Diagnos section. Actually, hypertension is retained but diabetes is added. That's one meaningful addition. The DVT part remains unchanged.

**Vårdförlopp (Clinical Course)**:
- Lab findings (MetHb, Hb, no infection signs) are identical initially.
- Key changes:
  1. **Exposure history**: Original mentions unprotected sex, fever, rash. Modified adds ""använt många droger... injektioner"" (drug use/injections) and ""Inga hepatitvaccin"" (no hepatitis vaccines). Also adds hepatitis B co-infection. This is significant for transmission risks.
  2. **Neurological explanation**: Original suggests HIV as cause for neuro symptoms; modified changes this to ""sepsis?"" – a different diagnostic hypothesis.
  3. **Oxygen saturation & disposition**: Original: 94% on room air, discharged. Modified: 84% requiring ICU transfer for IV antibiotics and monitoring. This indicates clinical deterioration.
  4. **Added sepsis management**: ICU transfer and antibiotics (Cefoxitin) reflect new diagnosis.

**Läkemedel (Medications)**:
- Original: Omeprazol, Eliquis, Betolvex, Madopark, Requip, Mirtazapin, Tivicay, Truvada.
- Modified: Adds Entecavir (for hepatitis B) and Cefoxitin (for sepsis), while keeping others. Two new drugs for new conditions.

**Planering (Follow-up)**:
- Original: Infection and neuro clinics.
- Modified: Adds coagulation clinic, intensive physiotherapy, and care needs assessment. Expanded care plan.

**Diagnos (Diagnoses)**:
- Original: Parkinson's, hypertension, DVT.
- Modified: Adds ""Sepsis"" as primary, keeps others. Hepatitis B is now listed under main diagnoses with ICD codes.

**Huvuddiagnos (Main Diagnoses)**:
- Original: HIV (B23.8), hemolytic anemia (D59.9).
- Modified: Sepsis (A41.9) as primary, keeps HIV, replaces anemia with acute hepatitis B (B16). Complete shift in primary diagnosis.

**Summary of meaningful changes**:
1. Added diabetes in past history.
2. Added drug use/injection history and lack of hepatitis vaccines.
3. Added hepatitis B co-infection.
4. Changed neurological symptom cause from HIV to sepsis.
5. Added sepsis diagnosis and ICU transfer due to low saturation (84% vs 94%).
6. Added Entecavir and Cefoxitin to medications.
7. Expanded follow-up to include coagulation clinic and physiotherapy.
8. Added sepsis to diagnoses and made it primary.
9. Replaced hemolytic anemia with acute hepatitis B in main diagnoses.

Each change alters clinical management or interpretation. Rephrasings (e.g., ""förklarars av"" vs ""kan förklarars av"" are negligible). Total distinct meaningful changes: **9**.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasing or synonymous changes. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. In ""Tidigare sjukdomar"", the modified version replaces ""Hypertension"" and ""Djup ventrombos bilateralt"" with ""Diabetes mellitus typ 2"" and ""Hjärnslag"" - that's two clear medical changes. 

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"", the key difference is the neurological symptoms explanation changing from ""HIV-infektion"" to ""sepsis"" - another medical meaning alteration. The ""Planering"" section adds ""koagulations-"" to follow-up clinics, which seems clinically relevant. 

In ""Diagnos"", ""Sepsis"" and ""Diabetes"" are added while ""Hypertension"" is removed - three distinct changes. The ""Huvuddiagnos"" remains identical though. 

I notice minor non-meaningful changes like ""In"" to ""Inga"" or ""etter"" to ""efter"" that shouldn't count. The total meaningful changes are: previous diseases (2 changes), symptom attribution (1), planning (1), and diagnoses (3) - summing to 7. 

The HIV diagnosis and anemia remain consistent, while new elements like diabetes and sepsis introduction significantly alter the clinical picture. The coagulation follow-up addition also modifies care planning. All counted changes affect medical interpretation.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring synonymous rephrasings. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Sökorsak"" becomes ""Orsak till jour sökande"" - this is just a synonym change (""reason for seeking care"" vs ""reason for emergency visit"") with no medical impact. 

In the care process (""Vårdförlopp"" vs ""Sjudomsförlopp på avdelningen""), most changes are trivial: ""EF"" to ""ejektionsfraktion"" (standard abbreviation expansion), ""MetHb"" unchanged, ""In tecken"" corrected to ""Inga infektions tecken"" (grammar fix), ""Testade positivt"" vs ""HIV-test positivt"" (equivalent phrasing). 

Notable changes appear in: 
- ""antiviralbehandling (Truvada och Tivicay)"" replacing ""behandling med Truvada och Tivicay"" - specifies treatment type but doesn't alter meaning since the drugs are identical. 
- ""Dessutom"" instead of ""Även"" for fasciculations - synonymous. 
- ""med inga fynd"" vs ""utan tecken"" in MRI description - same meaning. 
- ""Elektromyografi"" spelled out instead of ""EMG"" - standard abbreviation. 

The medication list and diagnoses are identical. Crucially, all clinical findings (Hb levels, neurological signs, test results) remain unchanged. The HIV diagnosis revelation and treatment initiation are identically described. 

The only potential meaning change is in the anemia description: ""förvärvad hemolytisk anemi"" appears in both the original diagnosis and modified text's narrative, but was already implied in the original ""hemolytisk anemi"". No actual modification occurs. 

After thorough review, I conclude there are zero medically significant changes - all alterations are linguistic or grammatical without affecting clinical content. The count remains at zero.

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Sökorsak"" vs ""Orsak till jour sökande"" header change seems purely terminological - both mean ""reason for seeking care"". The ""vistelse"" to ""resa"" substitution (stay vs trip) also feels like a non-medical synonym swap. 

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"", I spot three potential changes: 
""Normal EF"" expanded to ""Normal ejektionsfraktion"" - this is just spelling out an abbreviation, no meaning shift. 
""In tecken"" corrected to ""Inga infektions tecken"" - the original was clearly a typo, now fixed to ""no signs of infection"". 
""Testade positivt för HIV"" vs ""HIV-test positivt"" - identical meaning, just rephrased. 

The rest - including medications, diagnoses and neurological findings - appears identical. The HIV explanation question and discharge details are unchanged. 

Crucially, all medical facts remain consistent: the hemolytic anemia investigation, neurological symptoms, test results, and treatment decisions are preserved. Even the ICD codes match perfectly.

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified Swedish medical texts for Case ID medicine_5 and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll ignore rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

First, looking at the sections:

1. **Sökorsak vs. Orsak till jour sökande**: The modified version changes the section title. ""Sökorsak"" means ""reason for seeking care,"" and ""Orsak till jour sökande"" is ""reason for emergency visit."" This might imply a different context (emergency vs. general), so it's a meaningful change.

2. **""vistelse i Spanien"" to ""resa till Spanien""**: ""Stay"" vs. ""trip."" Both imply being in Spain, so this is a synonym change without medical impact. Ignore.

3. **Tidigare sjukdomar section**: No changes here. Same content.

4. **Vårdförlopp vs. Sjudomsförlopp på avdelningen**: The section title changes from ""Care course"" to ""Disease course in the department."" This could alter the focus from care process to disease progression, which might be meaningful.

5. **""Normal EF"" to ""Normal ejektionsfraktion""**: Abbreviation expanded. EF is ejektionsfraktion, so no meaning change. Ignore.

6. **""In tecken"" to ""Inga infektions tecken""**: Original has a typo (""In"" instead of ""Inga""), but corrected in modified. ""No signs of infection"" is the intended meaning in both. The correction fixes the typo but doesn't change meaning. Ignore.

7. **""Testade positivt för HIV"" vs. ""HIV-test positivt""**: Both mean tested positive for HIV. Rephrasing, no change.

8. **""behandling med Truvada och Tivicay"" to ""antiviralbehandling (Truvada och Tivicay)""**: Specifying as antiviral treatment is more precise but the drugs are the same. This adds clarity but doesn't change the treatment itself. Could be considered a meaningful clarification? However, since the drugs are named, it might not alter medical meaning. I'll note it but might not count.

9. **""Dessutom"" instead of ""Även"" for fascikulationer**: Synonym, no change.

10. **""utan tecken till"" vs. ""med inga fynd som skulle tyda på""**: Both say no signs of ALS or Parkinson plus. Rephrasing, same meaning.

11. **""EMG"" to ""Elektromyografi""**: Abbreviation spelled out. No change.

12. **""LP utan avvikande fynd hitills""**: Same in both.

13. **""Neurologiska symtom kan förklarars av HIV-infektion?""**: Both have the same question, though original has a typo (""förklarars"" should be ""förklaras""). Modified corrects it but meaning unchanged.

14. **""Patienten saturerar sig på 94% på rumsluft"" vs. ""Patienten 94% saturation på rumsluft""**: The original says ""saturates at 94% on room air,"" while modified is more concise. The meaning is the same, so no change.

15. **Läkemedel section title changed to specify ""vid utskrivning""**: This clarifies it's medications at discharge, which might be a meaningful addition if the original didn't specify timing. However, in context, both refer to current meds, so likely no impact.

16. **Planering section**: ""Uppföljning på infektions-och neurologmottagningen"" vs. ""Uppföljning polikliniskt med infektions-och neurologspecialister."" The modified specifies ""polikliniskt"" (outpatient) and ""specialister"" (specialists). This adds detail about the setting and type of follow-up, which could be meaningful as it clarifies the care setting.

17. **Diagnos section**: ""DVT"" vs. ""Djup ventorombos"" – DVT is the abbreviation for deep vein thrombosis, so expanding it doesn't change meaning. ""Djup ventrombos"" in original vs. ""Djup ventorombos"" in modified – likely a typo in modified (""ventorombos"" should be ""ventrombo's"" or similar), but both mean DVT. No change.

18. **Huvuddiagnos vs. Primärdiagnos**: Changed from ""Main diagnosis"" to ""Primary diagnosis."" This is a terminology update but doesn't alter the diagnoses listed (B23.8 and D59.9 are the same). So, no medical meaning change.

Now, counting meaningful changes:

1. Section title change from ""Sökorsak"" to ""Orsak till jour sökande"" – implies emergency context.
2. Section title change from ""Vårdförlopp"" to ""Sjudomsförlopp på avdelningen"" – shifts focus to disease course.
3. In the planering section, specifying ""polikliniskt"" and ""specialister"" adds detail about outpatient follow-up with specialists, which is a meaningful clarification of the care plan.

Other changes are synonyms, abbreviations, or corrections that don't alter medical meaning. The antiviral treatment rephrasing adds clarity but since the drugs are named, it's not a meaningful change in treatment. 

So, total meaningful changes: 3.

Alright, let's tackle this medical text comparison. The task is to count meaningful changes in the modified Swedish clinical case that alter medical meaning, ignoring rephrasings or synonyms. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

**Sökorsak (Reason for seeking care):**
- Original mentions ""buksmärta och gulsot"" (abdominal pain and jaundice)
- Modified deletes ""och gulsot"" → **1 meaningful deletion** (jaundice is a key symptom)

**Tidigare sjukdomar (Past medical history):**
- Original includes ""Anorexia nervosa"" and ""Återfall av alkoholberoende i december""
- Modified deletes both → **2 meaningful deletions** (removes psychiatric history and alcohol relapse context)

**Vårdförlopp (Clinical course):**
- ""Illamående men inga kräkningar. Ingen feber. Ikterus i hud och sklera."" → Modified deletes ""Ikterus..."" (jaundice exam finding) → **1 deletion**
- ""svår klåda och buksmärta"" → Modified deletes ""svår klåda"" (severe itching) → **1 deletion**
- ""Prednisolon... patienten förbätrrades med upnådd dagligt kalorimål. Försämrades åter... blodtillblandade"" → Modified deletes entire deterioration episode with bloody vomiting → **1 deletion** (critical complication)
- ""Erhöll glypressin, Nexium"" deleted from medication administration → **1 deletion**
- ""Spontanläkande alkoholhepatit"" → Modified changes to ""Spontanläkande hepatit"" (removes ""alcohol"" etiology) → **1 modification**

**Diagnos (Diagnoses):**
- Original lists three diagnoses including anorexia and GI bleeding
- Modified keeps only ""KOL"" → **2 deletions** (removes two diagnoses)

**Huvuddiagnos (Main diagnosis):**
- ""K70.1 Alkoholhepatit"" → Modified changes to ""K70.1 Hepatit"" (removes ""alcohol"" specification) → **1 modification**

**Differentialdiagnos:**
- Unchanged

**Other sections:**
- Läkemedel, Planering, Undersökningar unchanged
- ""Glasgow scale"" shortened to ""Glasgow"" – not meaningful
- ""bilirubin 680"" and normalization details deleted – already covered in jaundice deletion

**Total meaningful changes:**
1. Sökorsak jaundice deletion
2-3. Past history anorexia + alcohol relapse deletions
4. Vårdförlopp jaundice exam deletion
5. Severe itching deletion
6. Deterioration with bloody vomiting deletion
7. Glypressin/Nexium deletion

Alright, let me tackle this medical text evaluation task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions where the modification type is ""delete"". 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Sökorsak"" section shows deletion of ""och gulsot"" from the original's ""buksmärta och gulsot"". Since jaundice is a key symptom indicating liver dysfunction, this removal alters the clinical presentation meaningfully.

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"", I notice three deletions: 
1) ""Ikterus i hud och sklera"" - this physical finding of jaundice is clinically significant
2) ""svår klåda"" from the decompensation description - pruritus can indicate cholestasis
3) The entire bilirubin value trend (""Bilirubin 290 sjunkande (680 initialt)"") which shows improvement

These aren't just rephrasings - they remove concrete clinical data. The other changes appear to be typos (""förbätrrades"" vs ""förbättrades"") which don't change meaning. 

The medication, planning, investigations and diagnosis sections remain identical. Therefore, I count four meaningful deletions that affect medical interpretation: the jaundice symptom, jaundice finding, pruritus symptom, and bilirubin trend.

Alright, let's tackle this medical text comparison. The task is to count meaningful changes between the original and modified Swedish clinical case, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

**Sökorsak (Reason for Visit):**  
Original mentions ""buksmärta och gulsot"" (abdominal pain and jaundice), while modified deletes ""gulsot"". This removal of jaundice as a presenting symptom is medically significant.

**Tidigare sjukdomar (Past Medical History):**  
Original includes ""Återfall av alkoholberoende i december"" (relapse of alcohol dependence in December), which is absent in modified. Deleting this alcohol relapse history meaningfully alters the clinical context.

**Vårdförlopp (Clinical Course):**  
- ""Ikterus i hud och sklera"" (jaundice in skin and sclera) is removed - another deletion of key physical finding.  
- ""svår klåda"" (severe itching) is missing from decompensation symptoms.  
- ""Bilirubin 680"" appears in original's clinical course but is absent in modified.  
- ""Bilirubin 290 sjunkande (680 initialt)"" follow-up is deleted.  
- ""Spontanläkande alkoholhepatit"" becomes ""Spontanläkande hepatit"" - removal of ""alkohol"" changes etiology specificity.  

**Diagnos (Diagnoses):**  
""Anorexia nervosa"" is deleted from the diagnoses list.  

**Huvuddiagnos (Primary Diagnosis):**  
""K70.1 Alkoholhepatit"" becomes ""K70.1 Hepatit"" - removing ""alkohol"" makes the diagnosis less specific.  

Now filtering out non-meaningful changes:  
- ""Glasgow scale 7 poäng"" → ""Glasgow 7 poäng"" is just abbreviation.  
- ""Karvedilol"" vs ""Carvedilol"" is spelling variation.  
- ""Kalorimål"" typo exists in both versions.  

Counting only meaningful deletions/modifications:  
1. Jaundice removal in Sökorsak  
2. Alcohol relapse history deletion  
3. Jaundice physical finding removal  
4. Severe itching symptom deletion  
5. Initial bilirubin value removal  
6. Follow-up bilirubin trend deletion  
7. ""Alkohol"" removal from spontaneous hepatitis  
8. Anorexia diagnosis deletion  
9. ""Alkohol"" removal from primary diagnosis  

That's 9 meaningful changes. The bilirubin deletions (items 5-6) might be debated, but since they document critical lab trends in liver disease, I consider them significant.

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified clinical cases in Swedish and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll ignore rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

First, looking at the ""Sökorsak"" section: The original says the patient had abdominal pain and jaundice for one month (""sedan en månad tillbaka""), but the modified version changes this to six months (""sex månader""). That's a significant change in symptom duration, which could affect diagnosis, so that's one meaningful change.

Next, in ""Tidigare sjukdomar"": The original mentions gastrointestinal bleeding in 2020 due to esophageal varices. The modified version removes this and adds GERD instead. Removing a history of varices and adding GERD alters the patient's medical history, which is important for understanding their current condition. That's two changes here—one deletion and one addition.

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"": The original CRP is 51, but in the modified, it's 5. That's a significant lab value change. Also, LPK changes from 13.5 to 11.5. ALAT goes from 1.61 to 2.61. These lab changes could indicate different inflammatory or liver issues. Then, the modified version adds a DT buk (CT abdomen) showing a suspected 6x5 cm tumor in the bile duct with a biopsy for suspected cholangiocarcinoma. This is a major addition not present in the original. Additionally, the modified adds Oxynorm for pain, which wasn't in the original. The original mentioned Prednisolon for decompensated alcoholic hepatitis, but the modified doesn't include this treatment. Also, the original had spontaneous healing of hepatitis and no need for further Prednisolon, which is absent in the modified. So, here we have several changes: CRP, LPK, ALAT values, addition of tumor and biopsy, addition of Oxynorm, and omission of Prednisolon details. That's at least five more changes here.

In ""Planering"": The original had a referral to gastroenterology for follow-up. The modified version changes this to an urgent referral to oncology due to the suspected malignant tumor. This is a significant change in care plan, so that's another meaningful change.

Other sections like ""Läkemedel"", ""Undersökningar"", ""Diagnos"", ""Huvuddiagnos"", and ""Differentialdiagnos"" seem unchanged. The medications list is identical. The diagnoses remain the same, though the modified case introduces a tumor, but the primary and differential diagnoses still focus on alcoholic hepatitis and liver failure, which might be inconsistent but not changed in the text.

So, tallying up: 
1. Symptom duration change (1 month to 6 months)
2. Removal of gastrointestinal bleeding/varices history
3. Addition of GERD
4. CRP from 51 to 5
5. LPK from 13.5 to 11.5
6. ALAT from 1.61 to 2.61
7. Addition of CT finding and biopsy for suspected cholangiocarcinoma
8. Addition of Oxynorm for pain
9. Omission of Prednisolon treatment and spontaneous healing mention
10. Change in referral from gastroenterology to urgent oncology

That's 10 meaningful changes. I should double-check if any of these are not significant. For example, the lab value changes might be considered minor, but since CRP and LPK indicate infection/inflammation, and ALAT is a liver enzyme, altering these values changes the clinical picture. The tumor addition is a major diagnostic change. The GERD addition and varices removal alter past medical history. The treatment changes (adding Oxynorm, omitting Prednisolon) affect management. The referral change is direct. So all these are meaningful. Therefore, the total count is 10.

Alright, let me tackle this medical case comparison. The task is to count meaningful changes between the original and modified Swedish clinical cases, ignoring rephrasing or synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

**Sökorsak (Reason for Visit):**
- Original: Symptoms for 1 month (""en månad"")
- Modified: Symptoms for 6 months (""sex månader"")
→ Meaningful change (duration affects diagnostic considerations)

**Tidigare sjukdomar (Past Illnesses):**
- Original: Gastrointestinal bleeding + esophageal varices (2020)
- Modified: GERD added, GI bleeding/varices removed
→ Meaningful change (different comorbidity profile)

**Vårdförlopp (Clinical Course):**
1. Lab changes: 
   - CRP 51 → 5 (significant inflammation marker change)
   - LPK 13.5 → 11.5 (white count change)
   - ALAT 1.61 → 2.61 (liver enzyme alteration)
2. Added findings: 
   - Suspected 6x5cm bile duct tumor + biopsy (new cancer suspicion)
   - Alcohol intoxication incident (BAC 2.5 with emptied hand sanitizer)
3. Removed: 
   - Prednisolon treatment for hepatitis
   - Calorie intake achievement
4. Outcome: 
   - Original: Discharged home
   - Modified: Absconded with false identity
→ Multiple meaningful changes (new pathology, removed treatments, altered outcome)

**Planering (Planning):**
- Original: Gastroenterology follow-up
- Modified: Urgent oncology referral + missing contact details
→ Meaningful change (different care pathway)

**Diagnoser (Diagnoses):**
- Removed: Gastrointestinal bleeding
- Added: GERD
- Main diagnosis changed from Alcoholic hepatitis (K70.1) to Cholangiocarcinoma (C22.1)
→ Core diagnostic alterations

**Other sections:**
- Medications identical
- Investigations identical (both gastroskopi)
- Differential diagnosis kept K70.4 but primary diagnosis overhauled

**Final tally:** 
I count 8 distinct meaningful changes affecting clinical interpretation:
1. Symptom duration
2. Comorbidity swap (varices→GERD)
3. Lab value alterations (CRP/LPK/ALAT)
4. Tumor discovery
5. Alcohol intoxication event
6. Prednisolon removal
7. Discharge vs abscondment
8. Main diagnosis + referral change

Minor notes: ""Brådskande remiss"" vs ""Remiss"" is consequential due to urgency. ""Spontanläkande"" remains but context shifts with cancer diagnosis. All changes directly impact management and prognosis.

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified clinical cases in Swedish and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll ignore rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

First, looking at the ""Sökorsak"" section: The original says the patient had abdominal pain and jaundice for one month (""sedan en månad tillbaka""), but the modified version changes this to six months (""sedan sex månader tillbaka""). That's a significant change in symptom duration, which could affect diagnosis, so that's one meaningful change.

Next, in the ""Vårdförlopp"" section: The original mentions ALAT as 1.61, but the modified version has 2.61. This lab value change might indicate different liver function, so that's another meaningful change. Also, the modified version adds a CT scan finding: ""DT buk, misstänkt 6 x 5 cm tumör i gallgången"" (suspected 6x5 cm tumor in the bile duct). This is a major addition suggesting a possible malignancy, which wasn't in the original. That's a third change. Additionally, the original specified ""dekompenserad alkoholhepatit"" while the modified just says ""dekompenserad hepatit."" Removing ""alkohol-"" could imply a different etiology, so that's a fourth change.

In the ""Planering"" section: The original refers to a referral to a gastroenterologist (""gastrologen""), but the modified version changes it to an oncologist (""onkolog""). This shift in specialist follow-up, likely due to the suspected tumor, is a fifth meaningful change.

Other sections like ""Läkemedel,"" ""Undersökningar,"" ""Diagnos,"" ""Huvuddiagnos,"" and ""Differentialdiagnos"" remain unchanged. The medication list is identical, and the diagnoses are the same except for the added tumor suspicion in the modified version's narrative.

I've identified five meaningful changes: symptom duration, ALAT value, addition of a tumor, specification of hepatit without ""alkohol,"" and the change in referral. Rephrasings like ""alkoholhepatit"" to ""hepatit"" and the specialist change are not mere synonyms but alter the medical context. Therefore, the total count is 5.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring synonymous rephrasing. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Sökorsak/Orsak till inläggning"" change seems purely terminological - both mean ""reason for admission"". The ""gulsot/ikterus"" substitution is medically equivalent (both mean jaundice). 

In ""Tidigare sjukdomar"", the expansion of KOL to full form and ""sekundärt till"" instead of ""på grund av"" don't alter meaning. The compliance phrasing change is identical in context.

The ""Vårdförlopp/Sjukhusförlopp"" header change is non-substantive. ""Afebril"" replacing ""Ingen feber"" is synonymous. ""Kroppsundersökning"" for ""undersökning"" adds no new data. The Glasgow scale mention has an odd insertion of ""alkoholhepatit"" in Modified - that might be an error but doesn't change the score meaning. 

Lab value order swaps (ALAT/ASAT) are insignificant. ""Trombprofylax/trombosprofylax"" is abbreviation vs full term. ""Noterades"" vs ""förelåg"" for renal failure are synonyms. Medication sections are identical.

Crucially, I spot no additions, deletions or clinically significant modifications. The ""alkoholhepatit"" insertion in Glasgow scale appears to be a documentation error rather than meaningful change. All alterations are either synonymous or stylistic.

Final count: zero meaningful changes.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between the original and modified Swedish clinical case, ignoring synonymous rephrasing. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Sökorsak"" vs ""Orsak till inläggning"" header change is just terminology - both mean ""Reason for admission"". The symptom description modification from ""gulsot"" to ""ikterus"" is medically equivalent since both terms refer to jaundice. 

In ""Tidigare sjukdomar"", expanding KOL to ""Kronisk obstruktiv lungsjukdom (KOL)"" adds no new information. The phrase ""sekundärt till"" instead of ""på grund av"" for esophageal varices is synonymous. The alcohol abstinence clarification ""uppger att han varit nykter"" is a minor wording change without medical impact.

Moving to the care process section: ""Vårdförlopp"" vs ""Sjukhusförlopp"" are equivalent headers. ""Angav"" replacing ""Beskrev"" for stool description is linguistic variation. ""Dålig efterlevnad"" instead of ""dålig compliance"" maintains the same meaning about medication adherence. ""Kroppsundersökning"" substituting ""undersökning"" is redundant since context implies physical exam. 

The lab values show a critical change: the modified version lists ALAT before ASAT (1.61 vs 4.52) while original had ASAT first. This reversal could be medically significant as AST/ALT ratio matters in liver disease. Also ""Glasgow alkoholhepatit scale"" appears modified - the original says ""Glasgow scale"" which typically refers to coma scale, while the added ""alkoholhepatit"" might reference a specific Maddrey score, potentially altering meaning.

For treatments: Specifying ""antibiotika (erytromycin)"" instead of just ""erytromycin"" adds clarity but doesn't change the drug given. ""Dossänktes"" changed to ""dosen...sänktes"" is grammatical. The carvedilol spelling correction from ""Karvedilol"" to ""Carvedilol"" is insignificant.

In the plan section, ""gastrologen"" vs ""gastroenterologisk poliklinik"" are functionally identical referrals. Diagnosis expansion of KOL to full term adds no new information.

The key medical meaning changes appear to be: 1) Reversed ALAT/ASAT order in lab results 2) Potential misinterpretation of Glasgow scale terminology. That makes two meaningful alterations.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring synonymous rephrasing. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The header changes like ""Sökorsak"" to ""Orsak till inläggning"" and ""Vårdförlopp"" to ""Sjukhusförlopp"" are just terminology updates without medical impact. Similarly, ""Planering"" becoming ""Vidare plan"" is administrative phrasing.

In the admission section, ""gulsot"" changing to ""ikterus"" is a pure synonym swap - both mean jaundice. The phrasing about symptoms lasting a month is identical in meaning despite minor wording differences.

The medical history section shows two notable changes: ""KOL"" expanded to ""Kronisk obstruktiv lungsjukdom (KOL)"" which is just clarification, and ""sekundärt till"" replacing ""på grund av"" for esophageal varices - same causal relationship. The sobriety statement adds ""uppger att han"" which emphasizes patient-reported status but doesn't change facts.

Moving to the hospital course, most alterations are linguistic: ""beskrev""→""angav"", ""lös och ljus""→""små mängder lös och ljus"" (adding quantity descriptor), ""dålig compliance""→""dålig efterlevnad"" (synonyms for medication adherence). The physical exam changes are rewordings (""hittades""→""noteras"", ""palpationsömhet""→""ömhet vid palpation"") with identical findings.

Lab values have one transposition (ALAT/ASAT order) but same results. The critical error is ""Glasgow scale 7"" becoming ""Glasgow alkoholhepatit scale 7"" - this incorrectly modifies a standardized neurological scale, constituting a medical meaning change.

Treatment details show minor additions: ""antibiotika (erytromycin)"" clarifies the pre-endoscopy drug, but since erythromycin's use for gastric motility is implied in original, this is elaboration rather than meaning change. ""Trombprofylax""→""trombosprofylax"" is abbreviation expansion.

All other sections (medications, investigations, diagnoses) have identical content. The carvedilol initiation date correction (2024-02-27) appears in both versions upon closer look.

Therefore, only the erroneous ""Glasgow alkoholhepatit scale"" modification qualifies as a meaningful change, as it alters medical interpretation. Final count is 1.

First, I'll systematically compare each section. In ""Sökorsak"", the modified version deletes ""Temp 39"" - that's a clinically significant removal of fever documentation. 

Moving to ""Tidigare sjukdomar"", diabetes mellitus typ 2 is deleted from the patient's history. This directly impacts medical understanding of comorbidities. 

In ""Vårdförlopp"", I notice ""utan feber eller smärta"" becomes just ""utan smärta"" - omitting fever resolution is medically relevant. Also, the initial P-kreatinin 137 mention is removed, though it reappears later as P-krea 128. 

The ""Läkemedel"" section shows metformin deleted - crucial since it's diabetes medication, and diabetes was removed from history. 

Finally in ""Diagnos"", diabetes remains listed despite being removed from history and medications - this seems inconsistent but isn't a direct change from original. 

So meaningful deletions are: 1) Temp 39, 2) Diabetes history, 3) Fever resolution, 4) Initial P-kreatinin, 5) Metformin. That's five changes. The P-krea later appears unchanged, and diabetes in diagnoses might be an error but isn't a modification from original.

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"": multiple deletions stand out - the CRP/leukocyte/kreatinin values, the mention of blood culture, and the infection parameter improvements are all medically relevant data points that disappeared. The pain relief medication (oxynorm) remains, but the fever resolution mention is gone. 

The ""Läkemedel"" section shows metformin removed - crucial since it's diabetes medication and the diabetes diagnosis was also deleted. ""Diagnos"" section confirms diabetes is missing, aligning with the medication change. 

Other sections seem identical. The ICD code and main diagnosis remain unchanged. All changes appear to be deletions rather than rephrasings - each alters the clinical picture by omitting comorbidities, vital signs, lab results or medications. 

Final count: 1) Temp deletion 2) Diabetes history removal 3-5) Three deleted lab values (CRP/leukocytes/kreatinin) 6) Blood culture omission 7) Infection parameter improvement deletion 8) Fever resolution removal 9) Metformin deletion 10) Diabetes diagnosis removal. That's 10 meaningful changes.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In **Sökorsak**, the modified version deletes ""rodnad"" (redness) and ""Temp 39"" (fever). These are clinically significant as they're key symptoms of erysipelas.

Under **Tidigare sjukdomar**, ""diabetes mellitus typ 2"" is removed. This affects comorbidity documentation and medication management.

The **Vårdförlopp** section has multiple deletions: 
- Omission of ""avgränsad rodnad"" (defined redness) and CRP/leukocyte/kreatinin values weakens infection severity documentation. 
- Removing the initial diagnosis rationale (""för misstänkt rosfeber"") and antibiotic switch details loses treatment context. 
- Deleting CRP/leukocyte normalization and creatinine improvement eliminates objective recovery evidence.

In **Läkemedel**, metformin is deleted - directly tied to the removed diabetes diagnosis.

The **Diagnos** section now omits diabetes mellitus typ 2, a major comorbidity.

Finally, the **Huvuddiagnos** completely deletes the specific ICD code and disease name (A46.9 Erysipelas), which is critical for coding and diagnosis.

I'm counting 7 distinct meaningful deletions that impact clinical understanding: 
1-2. Two symptoms in Sökorsak 
3. One comorbidity 
4-6. Three clinical details in Vårdförlopp 
7. One medication 
(Plus the diagnosis section changes which compound existing deletions)

The ICD code removal would be an eighth, but since it's part of the diagnosis framework, I'll consider it as part of the broader diagnostic information loss. The core deletions that alter medical management are the diabetes-related elements and infection parameters.

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original medical case with the modified version and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll ignore rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

First, looking at the **Sökorsak (Reason for Visit)** section:
- Original: The patient presented with swelling, redness, difficulty walking on the right leg, and a temp of 39°C.
- Modified: Now includes ""mycket svullet"" (very swollen) instead of ""svullnad"" (swelling), adds ""andnöd"" (shortness of breath) in one modified version, but the second modified version doesn't have shortness of breath. Temp is now 36°C instead of 39°C. The addition of shortness of breath is a meaningful change because it introduces a new symptom. The change in temperature from fever to normal is also significant as it's a key clinical sign. So that's two changes here.

Next, **Tidigare sjukdomar (Previous Illnesses)**:
- Original: Hypertension, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease stage 3.
- Modified: In one version, chronic kidney disease is replaced with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (KOL). The second modified version keeps chronic kidney disease. Replacing kidney disease with COPD is a meaningful change because it's a different comorbidity. But since the second modified version reverts to the original, I need to check which modified version we're comparing. The task mentions two modified versions? Wait, looking back, the user provided two modified versions? No, the user provided the original and two modified versions? Let me re-read the query. 

Wait, the user provided:
- Original
- Modified (first one)
- Then another section under ""## Sökorsak"" which seems like a second modified version? 

Looking closely, after the first Modified section, there's another block starting with ""## Sökorsak"" which is actually a second modified case. The task is to compare the original with the modified, but there are two modified versions presented. The user's instruction says ""Modified:"" and then another one. But the task says ""comparing two versions"" – original and modified. However, the user has provided two modified versions. 

Wait, re-reading the user's message: 
They present:
- Original
- Modified (first one)
- Then another section that starts with ""## Sökorsak"" – this is actually a second modified case? Or is it part of the same modified? 

Looking at the structure:
After the first Modified section, there's a line with ""## Sökorsak"" again, and then another case. It seems like the user has given two separate modified versions. But the task says ""comparing two versions"" – original and modified. This is confusing. 

Wait, the user's message ends with the second modified case and then the task instruction. So perhaps the user intended to compare the original with the second modified version? Or is the ""Modified"" section actually two parts? 

Let me parse the input again:

The user provided:
1. Original
2. Modified: (first modified case)
3. Then immediately after, another block starting with ""## Sökorsak"" which is a different modified case. 

But the task says: ""Modified:"" and then presents the first modified case, and then there's another one. The instruction at the end says ""Task: Count only meaningful changes..."" referring to the modified version. But which one? 

Looking back, the user says: ""Modified:"" and then the first block, and then there's a second block that starts with ""## Sökorsak"" which is actually a third version? Or is the second block part of the same modified? 

No, the structure is:
- Original
- Modified: (with its own sections)
- Then a new header ""## Sökorsak"" which starts another case. 

But the user's message ends with the second modified case and then the task. So perhaps the user provided two modified versions? But the task is to compare the original with the modified. This is ambiguous. 

Perhaps the user pasted two modified versions by mistake? Or is the second one the correct modified? 

Looking at the end of the user's message, after the second modified case, it says ""Task: Count only meaningful changes..."". So I think the user intended to compare the original with the second modified version. Because the first modified is labeled as ""Modified:"", and then there's another one without a label, but it's structured the same. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""Modified"" section includes both blocks? But that doesn't make sense. 

I think the user has provided:
- Original
- First Modified version (with COPD, etc.)
- Second Modified version (with DVT and PE, keeping kidney disease)

And the task is to compare the original with the second modified version? But the instruction says ""comparing two versions"" and the modified is presented as one. 

This is confusing. Let me check the case ID and variation type. The case ID is medicine_1 and variation type is ""modify"". But two modified are given. 

Perhaps the user pasted an extra case by mistake. The last section after ""Modified:"" is another version. 

To resolve this, I'll assume that the intended comparison is between the original and the last version presented, which is the one starting with ""## Sökorsak"" after the first modified. Because the first modified is labeled as ""Modified:"", and then there's another block which might be a second modified or a correction. But the task instruction comes after that, so likely the last one is the one to compare with original. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user provided the original, then a modified, and then another example? But the task says ""the modified"" version. 

Looking at the assistant's response requirement, it's a single number. 

I think I should compare the original with the second modified version that has the DVT and PE diagnosis, as it's the last one provided and comes right before the task instruction. 

So, proceeding with that:

**Original vs Second Modified Version**:

1. **Sökorsak**:
   - Original: Swelling, redness, difficulty walking, temp 39°C.
   - Modified: ""mycket svullet och rodnad samt svårighet att gå"" – adds ""very"" swollen. Temp 36°C. No mention of shortness of breath here. So changes: ""very swollen"" instead of ""swelling"", and temp from 39 to 36. Both are meaningful changes as they alter symptom severity and absence of fever.

2. **Tidigare sjukdomar**:
   - Original: Hypertension, DM2, CKD stage 3.
   - Modified: Same as original. No change.

3. **Vårdförlopp**:
   - Original: Swollen right lower leg with demarcated redness, pain on palpation. CRP 279, WBC 16.2. Creatinine 137. Blood culture, given penicillin IV for suspected erysipelas. Ultrasound negative for DVT. Pain relief with oxynorm, improved. CRP down to 147, WBC normalized, creatinine 128. Discharge planned.
   - Modified: Very swollen right lower leg with demarcated redness, pain on palpation. CRP 13 (lower), WBC 8.2 (normal), D-dimer 23.4 (high). Creatinine 137. Ultrasound showed DVT. Started apixaban. Pain relief with oxynorm, improved. Discharge planned. 
   Key changes: 
     - CRP and WBC values are much lower in modified (13 vs 279, 8.2 vs 16.2), indicating less infection.
     - Addition of D-dimer 23.4 mg/L (high), suggesting thrombosis.
     - Ultrasound now shows DVT (positive vs negative in original).
     - Treatment is apixaban (anticoagulant) instead of penicillin (antibiotic).
     - No mention of blood culture or antibiotics in modified.
     - Oxynorm still used for pain.
     - No follow-up on infection markers in modified, as the diagnosis changed.
   These are multiple meaningful changes: different lab results, different diagnosis (DVT instead of erysipelas), different medication.

4. **Läkemedel (Medications)**:
   - Original: Amlodipine, losartan, metformin, penicillin.
   - Modified: Amlodipine, losartan, metformin, apixaban (no penicillin). Penicillin is removed, apixaban added. Meaningful change in treatment.

5. **Planering (Planning)**:
   - Original: Oral antibiotics, no follow-up needed.
   - Modified: Oral anticoagulant for at least 6 months, follow-up at coagulation clinic. Meaningful change in management plan.

6. **Diagnos (Diagnoses)**:
   **Huvuddiagnos (Main Diagnosis)**:
   - Original: Erysipelas (A46.9)
   - Modified: Iliac vein thrombophlebitis (I80.2) and pulmonary embolism (I26.9). Completely different diagnoses.

So, summarizing meaningful changes:
1. Sökorsak: Change in symptom description (very swollen) and temperature (39 to 36).
2. Vårdförlopp: Different lab values (CRP, WBC, D-dimer added), ultrasound result (DVT present), treatment (apixaban instead of penicillin).
3. Läkemedel: Removal of penicillin, addition of apixaban.
4. Planering: Change from antibiotics to anticoagulants with follow-up.
5. Huvuddiagnos: From erysipelas to DVT and"

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:
- **Sökorsak**: Modified version reduces symptom severity (""lite svullnad"" instead of ""svullnad"", temp 38°C vs 39°C) and removes walking difficulty. This changes clinical presentation.
- **Vårdförlopp**: 
  - Examination now describes milder findings (""lite svullen"", ""inte så avgränsad rodnad"")
  - Lower inflammatory markers (CRP 179 vs 279, leukocytes 14.2 vs 16.2)
  - Crucial change: Ultrasound now shows DVT (thrombosis) instead of ruling it out
  - Antibiotic route changed from IV to oral from start
  - CRP improvement more pronounced (47 vs 147)
- **Läkemedel**: Added Elquis (apixaban) anticoagulant
- **Planering**: Added blood-thinning treatment
- **Huvuddiagnos**: Changed from erysipelas (A46.9) to iliac vein thrombosis (I80.2)

The DVT finding is particularly significant as it alters diagnosis and treatment. The medication addition and diagnosis change are clearly meaningful. Symptom severity reductions also modify clinical interpretation. 

I count 8 distinct medical meaning changes:
1-2. Two symptom modifications in Sökorsak
3-5. Three examination/Vårdförlopp alterations (symptoms, markers, ultrasound)
6. Initial antibiotic route
7. Added anticoagulant
8. Diagnosis change

Rephrasings like ""per os"" vs ""intravenöst/per oral"" aren't counted as they convey same meaning. The core changes revolve around the new thrombosis diagnosis and its management implications.

medicine_1,swedish,modify,Case_1_Medicine_Swedish_summary_mod_1.csv,"<think>
Alright, let's tackle this. I need to compare the original and modified Swedish clinical cases for medicine_1 and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. First, I'll go through each section step by step.

Starting with ""Sökorsak"": The original says ""svullnad, rodnad"" while the modified has ""lite svullnad, rodnad"". Adding ""lite"" (a little) to describe the swelling is a modification. It downplays the severity, which could be meaningful in a medical context as it might affect the perceived urgency or diagnosis. So that's one change.

Next, in ""Vårdförlopp"": The original describes ""svullen höger underben med avgränsad rodnad smärta vid palpation"". The modified version changes this to ""lite svullen... inte så avgränsad rodnad samt lite smärta"". Here, ""lite"" is added to swelling, ""inte så avgränsad"" (not so defined) replaces ""avgränsad"" for redness, and ""lite"" is added to pain. These modifications reduce the severity and specificity of symptoms. Since clinical findings like well-defined redness are key in diagnosing erysipelas, this could alter the medical interpretation. That's three changes here.

Also in ""Vårdförlopp"", the original mentions the patient received ""Bensylpenicillin 1 gram x 3 intravenöst"" initially, then switched to oral later. The modified version skips the IV part and directly states ""Får Fenoximetylpenicillin 1 gram x 3 per os"". Omitting the initial IV treatment is a significant deletion because it changes the treatment approach documented, which is crucial for understanding the care pathway. That's another change.

Looking at the ""Läkemedel"" section: Both list the same medications, including Kåvepenin (Fenoximetylpenicillin) with the same dosage. No changes here.

Other sections like ""Tidigare sjukdomar"", ""Operation"", ""Planering"", ""Diagnos"", and ""Huvuddiagnos"" are identical. The removal of the specific date when antibiotics were switched in the modified version's ""Vårdförlopp"" (original had ""Bensylpenicillin byts til per oral fenoximetylpenicillin... fram till 19/1"") isn't present in the modified text. This deletion might be meaningful as it removes information about the treatment duration and transition, which could be relevant for follow-up. So that's another change.

In total, the meaningful changes are: 

1. ""Sökorsak"": Adding ""lite"" to swelling.
2. ""Vårdförlopp"": Changing swelling to ""lite svullen"".
3. ""Vårdförlopp"": Modifying redness description to ""inte så avgränsad"".
4. ""Vårdförlopp"": Adding ""lite"" to pain.
5. ""Vårdförlopp"": Omitting initial IV antibiotic administration.
6. ""Vårdförlopp"": Removing the detail about switching antibiotics and the end date (19/1).

That makes six meaningful changes. Each of these alters the clinical picture or treatment documentation, which could impact medical decision-making or record accuracy.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In **Sökorsak**:
- ""rodnad"" → ""erytem"" (synonym for redness)
- ""höger ben"" → ""höger underextremitet"" (more precise anatomical term but same meaning)
- ""Temp"" → ""Kroppstemperatur"" (full form vs abbreviation)

**Tidigare sjukdomar**:
- ""Hypertoni"" → ""Högt blodtryck"" (direct synonym)
- ""diabetes mellitus typ 2"" → ""typ 2 DM"" (standard abbreviation)

**Vårdförlopp**:
- ""smärta vid palpation"" → ""ömhet vid palpation"" (synonyms for tenderness)
- ""Blododlas"" → ""Blododlingar tagna"" (equivalent phrasing)
- ""djup ventrombos"" → ""DVT"" (standard abbreviation)
- ""patientens fru"" → ""patientens partner"" (social term change, but medically irrelevant)
- Added ""i.v."" after Bensylpenicillin (clarifies administration route)

**Planering**:
- ""Peroral antibiotikabehandling"" → ""Fortsatt antibiotikamedicinering per os"" (equivalent terms)

Now evaluating medical impact:
- All changes are either synonyms or clarifications (like ""i.v."") without altering treatment meaning
- ""Partner"" instead of ""fru"" has no clinical significance
- Abbreviations (DM, DVT) are standard medical shorthand

Conclusion: Only one meaningful change - the explicit addition of ""i.v."" for antibiotic administration. The rest preserve original medical meaning.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

In **Sökorsak**:
- ""rodnad"" → ""erytem"" (synonym for redness, no meaning change)
- ""höger ben"" → ""höger underextremitet"" (more precise anatomical term, but same body part)
- ""Temp"" → ""Kroppstemperatur"" (full term vs abbreviation, same meaning)

**Tidigare sjukdomar**:
- ""Hypertoni"" → ""Högt blodtryck"" (direct synonym)

**Vårdförlopp**:
- ""smärta vid palpation"" → ""ömhet vid palpation"" (pain vs tenderness - subtle but clinically different)
- ""Blododlas"" → ""Blododlingar tagna"" (same meaning, passive vs active phrasing)
- ""DVT"" → ""djup ventrombos"" (abbreviation vs full term)
- ""Bensylpenicillin byts"" → ""Bensylpenicillin i.v. byts"" (added intravenous specification - meaningful as it clarifies administration route)
- ""P-kreatinin"" → ""Kreatinin"" (removed ""P-"" prefix, but context shows it's plasma creatinine)

**Planering**:
- ""Peroral"" → ""per os"" (Latin vs medical term, same meaning)

Other sections show no changes. 

The meaningful changes I identify are:
1. ""smärta"" to ""ömhet"" (clinical nuance in symptom description)
2. Adding ""i.v."" to specify intravenous administration
3. Removing ""P-"" from kreatinin (could be significant if distinguishing plasma vs serum, but context suggests equivalence)

That gives 3 meaningful changes. I'll verify by checking if any change could affect clinical decisions - the pain/tenderness distinction and IV specification seem clinically relevant.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring synonymous rephrasings. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. In ""Sökorsak"", ""rodnad"" becomes ""erytem"" - these are dermatological synonyms. ""Höger ben"" changes to ""höger underextremitet"" - still anatomically equivalent. No meaning shift.

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"": 
- ""DVT"" expands to ""djup ventrombos"" - just spelling out the acronym. 
- ""Bensylpenicillin byts..."" gains ""i.v."" specification, but context already implies intravenous route. 
- Both are clarifications without altering medical facts.

In ""Planering"", ""peroral"" becomes ""per os"" - identical administration routes in medical terminology. 

The medication list and diagnoses remain identical. All changes are either synonymous terms or explicit expansions of abbreviations that don't change clinical meaning. 

Final count: zero meaningful changes. The core medical narrative - from erysipelas diagnosis to treatment response - remains intact across both versions.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text evaluation task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. In ""Sökorsak"", the modified version deletes ""Hittats på golvet av personal på SÄBO"" - that's a meaningful deletion about the patient's found location and condition. 

Moving to ""Tidigare sjukdomar"", ""schizofreni"" is removed - definitely significant as it's a psychiatric comorbidity affecting care. 

The ""Vårdförlopp"" section has multiple deletions: 
- Missing CRP 143 and PCR positive for influenza A (lab results)
- Omission of initial antibiotic treatment (Oseltamivir/Cefotaxime) and clinical response
- Removal of CRP 199 trend and its interpretation
- Absence of mobilization/fall risk details
- Deleted medication switch rationale (Cefotaxim to Doxycyklin)

In ""Aktuella läkemedel"", Olanzapin is removed - crucial as it's an antipsychotic for the deleted schizophrenia diagnosis. 

The ""Diagnos"" section loses schizophrenia entirely. 

""Planering"" and ""Operation"" seem identical. 

Finally, ""Huvuddiagnos"" is completely emptied in the modified version - a major deletion of primary diagnoses. 

I'm counting each distinct medical fact removal as one change: 
1. Found on floor status 
2. Schizophrenia history 
3. Initial CRP/PCR results 
4. Antibiotic treatment details 
5. CRP trend data 
6. Fall risk documentation 
7. Antibiotic switch rationale 
8. Olanzapin medication 
9. Schizophrenia diagnosis

Alright, let's tackle this medical text evaluation. The task is to count meaningful changes between the original and modified Swedish clinical case, ignoring rephrasings or synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

**Sökorsak (Reason for Admission):**
- Original mentions patient was ""Hittats på golvet av personal på SÄBO"" (found on floor by staff at sheltered housing). Modified version deletes this. This is a meaningful deletion as it removes context about a fall/immobility event.

**Tidigare sjukdomar (Past Medical History):**
- Original includes ""schizofreni"" (schizophrenia). Modified deletes this. Significant deletion affecting psychiatric history and medication considerations.

**Vårdförlopp (Clinical Course):**
- Original CRP values: ""CRP 143"" on admission and ""CRP 199, stigande initialt"" later. Both deleted in modified. Removal of lab values impacts infection monitoring.
- Original states ""Patienten mår bättre efter antibiotika"" (feels better after antibiotics) – deleted. This clinical improvement is medically relevant.
- Original notes fall risk: ""har fallit gånger flera senaste tiden"" (fallen multiple times recently) – deleted. Affects mobility/safety assessment.
- ""Fick [...] Cefotaxime [...] för [...] misstänkt bakteriell på viral infektion"" simplified to just ""för influensainfektion"" in modified. The bacterial co-infection suspicion is omitted, altering treatment rationale.

**Aktuella läkemedel (Current Medications):**
- Olanzapin 10mg deleted in modified. Directly linked to deleted schizophrenia history – meaningful change.

**Diagnos (Diagnoses):**
- Schizophrenia diagnosis deleted entirely from both Diagnos and Huvuddiagnos sections. Significant omission.
- J15.0 bacterial pneumonia removed from Huvuddiagnos. Major diagnostic alteration.

**Other notes:**
- ""PCR positiv Influensa A"" remains – no change.
- Geriatric transfer details identical – no change.
- Doxycycline switch identically described – no change.

**Summary of meaningful changes:**
1. Fall incident on admission
2. Schizophrenia history
3. Initial CRP 143
4. Rising CRP 199
5. Clinical improvement post-antibiotics
6. Recent falls history
7. Specification of bacterial co-infection suspicion
8. Olanzapin medication
9. Schizophrenia diagnosis
10. J15.0 bacterial pneumonia as main diagnosis

medicine_2,swedish,delete,Case_2_Medicine_Swedish_summary_delete_1.csv,"<think>
Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified Swedish medical case and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. First, I'll go through each section one by one.

Starting with **Sökorsak (Reason for Admission)**: The original mentions the patient was found on the floor by staff at SÄBO. The modified version removes that detail. Since this info about being found on the floor could indicate a fall or mobility issue, which is medically relevant, this deletion is meaningful.

Next, **Tidigare sjukdomar (Previous Conditions)**: The original lists schizophrenia, but the modified version omits it. Schizophrenia is a significant psychiatric condition affecting care, so removing it is a meaningful change.

In **Vårdförlopp (Care Process)**, the modified version removes the sentence about the patient using a walker and having recent falls. This is important because falls are a geriatric risk factor and relate to mobility issues, impacting care planning. Deleting this alters the medical context.

Looking at **Aktuella läkemedel (Current Medications)**: Olanzapin, used for schizophrenia, is removed in the modified version. Since schizophrenia was also deleted earlier, removing its medication is consistent but still a meaningful change as it affects the patient's treatment plan.

Other sections like **Planering**, **Operation**, **Diagnos**, **Huvuddiagnos**, and **Differentialdiagnos** remain unchanged. The removal of schizophrenia from the Diagnos section in the earlier change is noted, but since it's part of the same deletion, it's counted once.

So, the meaningful changes are:
1. Removal of being found on the floor in Sökorsak.
2. Deletion of schizophrenia in Tidigare sjukdomar.
3. Removal of walker use and recent falls in Vårdförlopp.
4. Removal of Olanzapin in medications.

That's four meaningful changes. I should double-check if any other modifications were made. For example, in Vårdförlopp, the sentence about transport to geriatrics is still there, but the part about mobility aids and falls is gone. The rest seems unchanged. So, total of four.

medicine_2,swedish,modify,Case_2_Medicine_Swedish_summary_mod_2.csv,"<think>
Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified clinical cases in Swedish and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll go through each section step by step.

Starting with **Sökorsak**: The original says the patient was found on the floor by staff at SÄBO. The modified version states he was found outside SÄBÖ by family on their way to visit. The location and who found him are different, which could be meaningful if it affects the context of care, but since it's about the discovery scene, it might not change medical treatment. However, being found outside vs. inside could imply different circumstances, but I'm not sure if it's medically significant. I'll note it for now.

Next, **Vårdförlopp**: 
- The modified version adds ""Oorienterad, hallucinerar. Svårt att utföra kliniska undersökningen."" This indicates altered mental status, which is a significant medical change as it could relate to his schizophrenia or infection complications.
- Temp is 36.7 in modified vs. 38.7 original. Lower initial temperature might affect fever presentation, which is clinically relevant.
- CRP is 3 vs. 143 originally. A normal CRP initially suggests less inflammation, which contradicts the original high value, altering the infection severity assessment.
- The pathogen in the culture changed from Moraxella to Klamydia. Moraxella is a common respiratory pathogen, while Klamydia (likely Chlamydia) is atypical. This changes the suspected bacterial cause and treatment implications.
- Added info about finding tablets behind the bed, suggesting non-adherence to medication. This is crucial for his schizophrenia management and could explain symptoms.
- The plan adds continuing Olanzapin, addressing the adherence issue.

**Diagnos**: The bacterial pneumonia diagnosis specifies Klamydia as the cause instead of being unspecified. This is a meaningful change in etiology.

Other sections like medications and planning have minor additions (Olanzapin continuation) but the core meds are the same. The differential diagnosis remains unchanged.

Counting the meaningful changes:
1. Altered mental status addition.
2. Initial temperature difference.
3. Initial CRP value change.
4. Pathogen change in culture (Moraxella to Klamydia).
5. Medication non-adherence finding.
6. Specific bacterial cause in diagnosis.
7. Continuation of Olanzapin in planning.

That's 7 changes. I need to ensure each alters medical meaning. The location in Sökorsak might not directly affect treatment, so excluding that. The rest impact clinical assessment, treatment, and diagnosis.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text evaluation task. The goal is to count meaningful changes between the original and modified Swedish clinical case, ignoring rephrasing that doesn't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section:

**Sökorsak (Reason for Admission):**
- Age changed from 79 to 29 (significant - affects geriatric vs young adult care)
- Found by ""personal på SÄBO"" vs ""anhöriga på marken utanför SÄBO"" (location and finder differ - implies different fall context)

**Tidigare sjukdomar (Medical History):**
- Removed ""Avancerad KOL"" and ""benign prostatahyperplasi"" (major deletion - eliminates COPD and prostate conditions)
- Kept ""rökare"" and ""schizofreni""

**Vårdförlopp (Clinical Course):**
- Temperature: 38.7→36.7 (fever vs normal)
- CRP: 143→3 (markedly abnormal vs normal)
- PCR influensa positive → removed (key deletion)
- CT thorax findings completely changed: original infiltrates/nodule → absent in modified
- Treatment: Oseltamivir/Cefotaxime/Doxycycline → removed (major therapy change)
- Infection source: Moraxella → Klamydia (different bacteria)
- Mental status: Added hallucinations/disorientation/hotel delusion (new psychiatric elements)
- Added finding of hidden antipsychotics under bed
- Transferred to psychiatry instead of geriatrics

**Medication List:**
- Removed Tamiflu and Doxycycline (consistent with changed diagnosis)
- Kept others

**Diagnoses:**
- Entirely rewritten: Influenza/bacterial pneumonia/COPD/BPH → Only chlamydia pneumonia and schizophrenia
- Main diagnosis changed from influenza/pneumonia to schizophrenia exacerbation

**Planning:**
- CT follow-up removed → Psychiatry referral instead

Counting meaningful changes: Age, location of discovery, removed comorbidities, vital sign changes, deleted influenza findings, altered CT results, different infection source, new psychiatric symptoms, changed medications, different discharge destination, completely revised diagnoses. That's at least 10 distinct medical meaning alterations.

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified clinical cases in Swedish and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll ignore rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

First, looking at the ""Sökorsak"" section: The original says the patient was found on the floor by staff at SÄBO. The modified version states he was found outside SÄBÖ by family on their way to visit. The location change (floor vs outside) and who found him (staff vs family) are meaningful because it could indicate different circumstances of discovery, like a fall outside versus inside, which might affect clinical assessment.

Next, in ""Vårdförlopp"": The original temp is 38.7°C, modified to 36.7°C. That's a significant difference—fever vs normal temp—affecting the infection severity. CRP in original is 143, modified to 43. Lower CRP might suggest less inflammation. Also, the pathogen in the original is Moraxella in nasopharyngeal culture, changed to Klamydia. Moraxella catarrhalis is a common respiratory pathogen, while Klamydia could refer to Chlamydia, which might imply a different bacterial cause, altering antibiotic choices. The diagnosis section reflects this change, specifying bacterial pneumonia caused by Klamydia instead of being unspecified.

Other parts like medications, planning, and other diagnoses remain the same. The differential diagnosis is unchanged. So, the key changes are in the presentation (location found, temp, CRP), the identified pathogen, and the resulting diagnosis specificity. That's four distinct medical alterations.

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified Swedish medical texts and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll ignore rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

First, looking at the ""Sökorsak"" section:  
Original says ""misstänkt influensainfektion"" and ""personal på SÄBO"". Modified uses ""trolig influensainfektion"" and ""vårdpersonalen på SÄBO"". ""Misstänkt"" (suspected) vs ""trolig"" (probable) might imply a different level of certainty, which could be meaningful. ""Personal"" to ""vårdpersonalen"" is just a synonym (staff to healthcare staff), so no change there. So one meaningful change here.

Next, ""Tidigare sjukdomar"":  
Original has ""Avancerad KOL, rökare"". Modified expands KOL to ""kronisk obstruktiv lungsjukdom"" and adds ""aktiv"" to rökare (active smoker). Expanding an acronym to full form doesn't change meaning, but adding ""aktiv"" specifies current smoking status, which is a meaningful medical detail. So that's another change.

In ""Vårdförlopp"":  
- ""Hittats på golvet"" vs ""Funnen på golvet"" – synonymous, no change.  
- ""har haft huvudvärk"" vs ""berättar om huvudvärk"" – changes from having symptoms to reporting symptoms. This could imply the source of information (patient report vs observation), which might be meaningful in a clinical context. So that's a change.  
- ""Inget avvikande i status"" vs ""Inga fynd i status"" – synonymous (no abnormalities vs no findings).  
- ""nodulär förändring"" to ""nodulär lesion"" – ""förändring"" (change) and ""lesion"" are often interchangeable in radiology, so likely not meaningful.  
- ""Dyspné endast vid mobilisering"" vs ""Dyspné endast då patienten mobiliserar sig"" – rephrasing with same meaning.  
- ""Transporteras ... enligt rekommendation"" vs ""på rekommendation"" – synonymous.  

Other sections like ""Aktuella läkemedel"", ""Planering"", ""Operation"", ""Diagnos"" are identical.  

So, meaningful changes are:  
1. Sökorsak: ""misstänkt"" to ""trolig"" (certainty level change).  
2. Tidigare sjukdomar: adding ""aktiv"" to rökare.  
3. Vårdförlopp: ""har haft"" to ""berättar om"" (symptom reporting method).  

Total: 3 meaningful changes.

Alright, let's tackle this medical text comparison. The task is to count meaningful changes between the original and modified Swedish clinical case, ignoring synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, scanning the sections: Sökorsak has ""misstänkt"" changed to ""trolig"" (both imply suspicion/probability) and ""personal"" to ""vårdpersonalen"" (equivalent). No meaning shift. 

Tidigare sjukdomar expands ""KOL"" to ""kronisk obstruktiv lungsjukdom"" (full term vs abbreviation) and adds ""aktiv"" to ""rökare"". The expansion is clarification without new info, but ""aktiv rökare"" specifies current smoking status - that's a meaningful addition about risk factors. 

Vårdförlopp: 
- ""Hittats"" to ""berättar om"" changes observed finding to patient-reported symptom - significant for symptom reliability. 
- ""Inget avvikande i status"" to ""Inga fynd i status"" is synonymous. 
- ""nodulär förändring"" to ""nodulär lesion"" - medical equivalence. 
- ""Dyspné endast vid mobilisering"" vs ""då patienten mobiliserar sig"" - same meaning. 
- ""Transporteras... enligt rekommendation"" to ""på rekommendation"" - no change. 

Planering becomes ""Plan efter utskrivning"" - clearer but same intent. Operation adds ""utförd"" for emphasis, no new info. 

Diagnos/Huvuddiagnos: ""KOL"" expanded again (no change), ""Huvuddiagnos"" to ""Primär diagnos"" (terminology update, same meaning). 

Differentialdiagnos identical. 

Medication list unchanged. 

Key meaningful changes: 
1. ""aktiv rökare"" addition (new clinical detail) 
2. Symptom reporting shift from observed (""Hittats"") to subjective (""berättar om"") 

That's 2 meaningful changes. Other modifications are linguistic refinements without clinical impact.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring synonyms that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. In ""Sökorsak"", ""misstänkt"" becomes ""trolig"" - both mean suspected/likely, so no medical impact. ""Personal"" to ""vårdpersonalen"" is just specification of staff type. 

Moving to ""Tidigare sjukdomar"": ""KOL"" is expanded to ""kronisk obstruktiv lungsjukdom"" - this is a full term expansion, not a meaning change. ""Rökare"" to ""aktiv rökare"" adds activity status, which could be clinically relevant as it specifies current smoking. 

The rest of the document appears identical - ""Vårdförlopp"", medications, planning, and diagnoses sections show no changes. The differential diagnosis remains unchanged too. 

So the only potential meaningful change is ""rökare"" → ""aktiv rökare"". The addition of ""aktiv"" specifies current smoking status, which could influence treatment considerations (like smoking cessation counseling). Other changes are either synonymous or explanatory without altering medical facts. 

Therefore, the count of meaningful changes is 1.

medicine_3,swedish,delete,Case_3_Medicine_Swedish_summary_delete_3.csv,"<think>
Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified Swedish medical case and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll ignore rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

Starting with ""Sökorsak"" (Reason for seeking care). The original mentions ""buksmärta samt förstoppning i 4 dagar och kräkningar"" (abdominal pain along with constipation for 4 days and vomiting). The modified version only has ""buksmärta"" (abdominal pain). So, the constipation and vomiting symptoms are deleted. That's a meaningful deletion because it removes key symptoms affecting diagnosis and treatment.

Next, ""Tidigare sjukdomar"" (Previous illnesses). Original includes appendectomy as a child and chronic ileitis from a biopsy. Modified only has hypothyroidism and a previous hospitalization in January. Removing appendectomy and chronic ileitis is significant because these are relevant to gastrointestinal history, especially since ileitis relates to Crohn's, a differential diagnosis.

In ""Vårdförlopp"" (Care process):
- Original CRP is 49; modified omits this. CRP is a marker for inflammation, so deleting it removes important lab data.
- Original mentions ""kräkningar"" (vomiting) in the worsened symptoms; modified says ""problem att äta"" (problems eating) without specifying vomiting. This deletion could affect understanding of symptom severity.
- Original states ""DT-buk med tecken på ileit i terminal ileum"" (CT abdomen showing signs of ileitis). Modified omits this entirely. This is a critical finding as it supports the ileitis diagnosis and relates to Crohn's.
- Original notes CRP 29 at discharge; modified omits this. Tracking CRP change (49 to 29) shows improvement, so deleting it removes clinical progress info.
- The phrase ""på grund av illamående och kräkningar"" (due to nausea and vomiting) is shortened to ""problem att äta"" (problems eating). While ""illamående"" (nausea) is implied in eating problems, removing explicit vomiting is a deletion.

Under ""Diagnos"" (Diagnosis), original lists ""Förstoppning"" (constipation) which is missing in modified. This deletion affects the documented conditions.

In ""Differentialdiagnos"" (Differential diagnosis), original includes ""Celiaki"" and ""Gastroenterit"" which are absent in modified. Removing celiac disease and gastroenteritis narrows the diagnostic considerations, which is a meaningful change.

Other changes seem like rephrasing without altering meaning, such as ""Uppger att han inte varit helt Återställd"" vs. similar in modified. Also, medication and planning sections are identical.

So, meaningful deletions:
1. Constipation and vomiting in Sökorsak.
2. Appendectomy and chronic ileitis in Tidigare sjukdomar.
3. CRP 49 in Vårdförlopp.
4. Vomiting details in worsened symptoms.
5. CT abdomen showing ileitis.
6. CRP 29 at discharge.
7. Constipation in Diagnos.
8. Celiaki and Gastroenterit in Differentialdiagnos.

That totals 8 meaningful changes.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions where the modification type is ""delete"". 

First, I'll systematically compare each section of the original and modified texts. The ""Sökorsak"" section shows a key deletion: the modified version omits ""och kräkningar"" (and vomiting) from the patient's presenting symptoms. This is medically significant as vomiting affects differential diagnosis and management.

In ""Tidigare sjukdomar"", I notice two deletions: the removal of ""Appendektomerats som barn"" (appendectomy in childhood) and ""Biopsi i januari visade kronisk ileit"" (January biopsy showing chronic ileitis). Both are clinically relevant historical details that could influence current assessment.

The ""Vårdförlopp"" section has multiple meaningful deletions: 
- ""svår"" (severe) before buksmärta (abdominal pain) is removed, potentially downplaying symptom severity
- ""kräkningar"" (vomiting) is deleted from the eating problems description
- The phrase ""på grund av illamående"" (due to nausea) is also omitted

These changes collectively alter the clinical picture by minimizing gastrointestinal symptoms. The rest of the document appears identical - medications, planning, operations and diagnoses sections show no changes. 

I count 5 distinct medical meaning alterations: 1) vomiting in presentation 2) appendectomy history 3) chronic ileitis finding 4) pain severity descriptor 5) nausea as cause of eating problems. The response should be a single number without explanation.

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified Swedish medical case and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll ignore rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

First, looking at the ""Sökorsak"" section: The original mentions ""buksmärta samt förstoppning i 4 dagar och kräkningar"" while the modified only has ""buksmärta."" So the constipation and vomiting symptoms are deleted. That's a meaningful deletion because it removes key presenting symptoms.

Next, in ""Tidigare sjukdomar"": The original includes ""Appendektomerats som barn"" and details about a previous January admission for abdominal pain with biopsy showing chronic ileitis. The modified version removes the appendectomy and the specific reason for the January admission (abdominal pain) and the biopsy result. Deleting the appendectomy history and the chronic ileitis diagnosis is significant as it affects the patient's medical history relevant to current symptoms.

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"": Several changes here. The original describes ""svår buksmärta"" (severe pain) modified to just ""buksmärta"" (pain). Removing the severity is meaningful. Also, the original mentions ""problem att äta på grund av illamående och kräkningar"" which in the modified becomes just ""problem att äta"" – deleting the nausea and vomiting cause. Additionally, the original's DT-buk showing ileitis is completely removed in the modified version. The gastroskopi result ""Visar duodenopati"" is also deleted. These are all clinically significant removals affecting diagnostic information.

The ""Diagnos"" section remains unchanged, so no issues there. Other sections like medications, planning, operation, and differential diagnoses appear identical.

In summary, the meaningful deletions are:
1. Constipation and vomiting in Sökorsak.
2. Appendectomy and chronic ileitis in Tidigare sjukdomar.
3. Pain severity, nausea/vomiting as cause for eating problems, DT-buk ileitis finding, and duodenopathy in Vårdförlopp.

That's 6 distinct medical deletions. I should confirm if any are interconnected. For example, removing ""förstoppning"" and ""kräkningar"" in Sökorsak are two separate symptoms. Similarly, in Tidigare sjukdomar, appendectomy and chronic ileitis are two points. In Vårdförlopp, severity of pain, cause of eating problems (two symptoms: nausea/vomiting), DT-buk finding, and duodenopathy – that's four more. Total of 6 meaningful deletions that alter medical meaning.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text evaluation task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasing that doesn't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically go through each section:

In ""Tidigare sjukdomar"":
- Original mentions ""Appendektomerats som barn"" and ""Biopsi i januari visade kronisk ileit""
- Modified changes to ""Magsmärtproblematik som barn"" and ""Biopsi i januari utan fynd""
These are significant: appendectomy vs nonspecific abdominal issues, and chronic ileitis vs normal biopsy. That's two changes.

In ""Vårdförlopp"":
- Original DT-buk shows ""tecken på ileit"", modified says ""normal, inga fynd"" - clear diagnostic change.
- Modified adds admission reason ""på grund av magsmärtan och förstoppningen"" which wasn't explicitly stated before.
- Gastroskopi result changes from ""visar duodenopati"" to ""Negativ"" - important finding alteration.
That's three more changes.

Other sections like medication, planning, and diagnoses appear identical. The ""Biopsi tagen"" line might seem changed but actually both versions mention biopsy for celiac - the meaningful change is in the earlier result.

Total meaningful changes: 5. I'll confirm by rechecking:
1. Childhood history alteration
2. January biopsy result reversal
3. DT-buk finding negation
4. Added admission reason
5. Gastroskopi result change

Yes, these all impact medical interpretation. The count should be 5.

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified Swedish medical cases and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll ignore rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

First, looking at the ""Tidigare sjukdomar"" section. The original mentions ""Appendektomerats som barn"" (appendectomy as a child) and ""Biopsi i januari visade kronisk ileit."" The modified version changes this to ""Magsmärtproblematik som barn"" (stomach pain as a child) and ""Biopsi i januari utan fynd"" (biopsy in January without findings). So, the removal of the appendectomy history and the change from chronic ileitis to no findings in the biopsy are significant. That's two changes here.

Next, in ""Vårdförlopp."" The original has LPK 8.9 and CRP 49, no fever. The modified version shows LPK 18.9, CRP 149, and fever of 38.5°C. These lab value changes and the addition of fever are medically significant. Then, the DT-buk in the original shows ileitis in the terminal ileum, while the modified version indicates signs of appendicitis. That's a crucial diagnostic change. Also, the original mentions admission to gastroenterology due to the findings, but the modified specifies admission due to stomach pain with a conservative treatment plan. The gastroskopi result in the original shows duodenopathy, but the modified says ""Negativ."" These are four more changes (lab values, fever, DT-buk finding, admission reason, gastroskopi result). 

The ""Huvuddiagnos"" changes from R104X (unspecified abdominal pain) to K35 (acute appendicitis). That's another key change. 

Other sections like medications, planning, operation, and other diagnoses remain the same. So, adding up: two changes in ""Tidigare sjukdomar,"" four in ""Vårdförlopp,"" and one in ""Huvuddiagnos."" Total of seven meaningful changes.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count only meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring rephrasings that don't alter medical meaning. 

First, I'll systematically go through each section. In ""Tidigare sjukdomar"", the original mentions appendectomy and chronic ileitis biopsy, while modified changes to ""magsmärtproblematik"" and ""utan fynd"" - that's two clear medical meaning changes. 

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"", the modified version has significantly elevated LPK (22.9 vs 8.9) and CRP (249 vs 49), plus added fever of 40.5°C. The imaging finding changes from ileitis to appendicitis, leading to added appendectomy and antibiotics - that's five more meaningful changes. The gastroskopi result also changes from duodenopathy to negative.

In ""Aktuella läkemedel"", added Cefoxitin antibiotic is another meaningful change. Finally, the ""Huvuddiagnos"" changes from unspecified abdominal pain to acute appendicitis - that's the ninth change.

I'm double-checking that minor phrasing differences like ""på¥"" typos or ""UJD05 Gastroskopi"" repetition don't count as meaningful. The differential diagnoses remain identical. All changes I counted directly impact diagnosis, treatment or clinical interpretation. 

Final count is 9 meaningful medical alterations.

medicine_3,swedish,synonyms,Case_3_Medicine_Swedish_summary_synonyms_2.csv,"<think>
Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified Swedish medical texts for Case ID medicine_3 and count only meaningful changes that alter medical meaning. First, I'll go through each section methodically.

Starting with **Sökorsak**: The original says ""46 årig man"" while modified uses ""46-år gammal man"". The addition of a hyphen and changing ""årig"" to ""år gammal"" is just a stylistic synonym—no medical impact. ""På grund av remiss"" replaces ""efter remiss"", which is a rephrasing without changing meaning. So no meaningful change here.

In **Tidigare sjukdomar**, both versions are identical. No changes detected.

Moving to **Vårdförlopp**: 
- ""Patienten uppger"" vs ""Patienten rapporterade"" – synonyms for reporting symptoms; no medical difference.
- ""bukstatus palpationsöm"" vs ""Status av buk visade palpationsöm"" – rephrasing, same finding.
- ""DT-buk med tecken på ileit"" vs ""DT-buk med indikation om terminal ileit"". Here, ""tecken på"" (signs of) and ""indikation om"" (indication of) are similar, but specifying ""terminal ileit"" instead of just ""ileit"" could be significant. However, the original's ""ileit i terminal ileum"" already specifies the location, so ""terminal ileit"" is just a condensed form. Likely synonymous in context.
- ""Inlägges på gastroenterologisk avdelning"" vs ""Inlägges på gastroenterologisk post"" – ""avdelning"" (department) and ""post"" (unit/ward) are hospital unit synonyms.
- ""problem att äta på grund av"" vs ""problem att äta till följd av"" – synonymous causal phrases.
- ""Patienten mår bättre"" vs ""Klinisk förbättring"" – the latter is more formal but describes the same improvement.
- All lab values and treatments (Ringer-acetat, glukos, etc.) are identical. The typo ""får"" persists in both under gastroskopi description.

**Aktuella läkemedel**, **Planering**, **Operation**, **Diagnos**, **Huvuddiagnos**, and **Differentialdiagnos** sections are verbatim matches. 

Noticing a consistent typo (""på¥"" in both under Tidigare sjukdomar) and ""Chrons"" (misspelling of Crohn's) in both versions' differentials. Since errors are identical, they don't count as changes.

Conclusion: All modifications are rephrasings or synonyms without altering medical content. The ""terminal ileit"" vs ""ileit i terminal ileum"" initially gave pause, but since the location is specified in the original, it's not a meaningful change. Thus, the count of meaningful changes is zero.

Alright, let me tackle this medical text comparison task. The user wants me to count meaningful changes between two Swedish clinical case versions, ignoring synonymous rephrasing. 

First, I'll systematically compare each section. The ""Sökorsak"" shows ""46 årig man"" vs ""46-år gammal man"" - that's just grammatical variation, no medical impact. 

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"": 
- ""uppger"" becomes ""rapporterade"" - same meaning
- ""bukstatus"" vs ""status av buk"" - identical
- ""SR"" expanded to ""sinus rytm"" - common abbreviation expansion
- ""tecken på ileit"" vs ""indikation om terminal ileit"" - ""tecken på"" and ""indikation om"" are synonyms, but ""terminal"" addition might matter. Wait, original already specified ""terminal ileum"" in DT-buk context, so this clarifies rather than changes meaning.
- ""avdelning"" to ""post"" - unit synonym
- ""till följd av"" replaces ""på grund av"" for symptoms - same causality
- ""klinisk förbättring"" replaces ""mår bättre"" - equivalent clinical terms

In ""Planering/Plan efter utskrivning"": header change is stylistic. 

Diagnosis section: 
- ""Huvuddiagnos"" to ""Primärdiagnos"" - synonymous headers
- ""Chrons"" expanded to ""Chrons sjukdom"" - full term but same disease

Noticing ""Rekommenderasts"" typo in modified version, but since it's identical to original's recommendation context, it doesn't alter meaning. 

All medication and values (VAS, CRP etc.) remain unchanged. The core clinical narrative - symptoms, tests, diagnoses, treatment - is preserved throughout. 

Final tally: zero meaningful medical changes. The variations are purely linguistic or formatting.

Alright, let's tackle this task. I need to compare the original and modified Swedish medical texts for Case ID medicine_3 and count only meaningful changes that alter the medical meaning. I'll ignore rephrasings or synonyms that don't change the meaning.

First, I'll go through each section one by one. Starting with ""Sökorsak"": The original says ""46 årig man"" and the modified has ""46-år gammal man"". Both mean the same thing—a 46-year-old man. The addition of a hyphen and using ""gammal"" instead of ""årig"" is just a synonym change. No medical impact here.

Next, ""Tidigare sjukdomar"" is identical in both versions. No changes at all.

Moving to ""Vårdförlopp"": The first line in the original says ""Patienten uppger svår buksmärta"" while the modified uses ""rapporterade"" instead of ""uppger"". Both verbs mean ""reported"" or ""states"", so that's a synonym swap without changing meaning. Then, in the EKG part, the original has ""SR"" and the modified expands it to ""sinus rytm"". Since SR is the abbreviation for sinus rhythm, this is just spelling out the acronym. Medical meaning remains the same. Later, the DT-buk in the original says ""med tecken på ileit"" and the modified uses ""med indikation om ileit"". ""Tecken på"" and ""indikation om"" both mean ""signs of"" or ""indications of"", so again, synonymous. The rest of this section is unchanged.

The sections ""Aktuella läkemedel"", ""Planering"", ""Operation"", ""Diagnos"", ""Huvuddiagnos"", and ""Differentialdiagnos"" are all identical between the two versions. No differences there.

So, all the changes I spotted are either synonyms or expansions of abbreviations that don't alter the medical content. Therefore, there are no meaningful changes that affect the medical meaning. The count should be zero.
